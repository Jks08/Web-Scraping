       "\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe operation theater is a completely disinfected place with all the instruments sterelised.\\nYou would be made to lie on the operation table on the back (supine position) or on the side (lateral decubitus). A traction table or different devices are used to apply traction to your affected leg. It is done to separate the 'ball' from the 'socket' to allow for sufficient access in the joint space. A few millimeters of traction is achieved this way.\\nAdequate padding would be placed on the operating table to support your body throughout the surgery and avoid any undue pressure on the pudendal, femoral, obturator or peroneal nerves.\\nAfter this, the area is painted with disinfectant and the surgery starts.\\nThe important anatomic landmarks are marked on the skin with an indelible marker.\\nNow a fine needle will be inserted to break the suction seal of hip joint to allow for further separation (hence more access).\\nArthroscopic fluid is inserted which makes it easier to see the joint space clearly and make space for insertion for instruments.\\nThe needle which was placed first is now removed and small points of entry (portals) are made on the skin using a new hollow needle, but in a different position.\\nA thin guide wire is passed through the hollow needle into the joint with help of X-ray guidance and the hollow needle is removed.\\nThe area around the guide wire is cut so that a cannula can be placed over it. After it is placed properly, the guide wire is removed. This is the first portal of entry through which further instruments can be inserted.\\nOnce the arthroscope is inserted, visual feed from the camera can now allow the surgeon to judge and create more portals of entry. At most, 4 portals can be made.\\nThus, one portal holds the arthroscope and others carry the surgical instruments (radiofrequency probe, hook probes, anchors etc.). Now any type of repair required is possible.\\nAfter  surgery is complete, traction is slowly released and this brings the ball and socket back to its original position, and position of the arthroscope is shifted.\\n\\nA few repairs that are carried out using arthroscopy:\\n\\nHip impingement syndrome (FAI): It is the impingement of articulating surfaces of the hip joint due to abnormal contact of the thigh bone with the hip bone. Cam-type (problem in femur) FAI and pincer-type FAI (problem in hip joint) are two variants. Technique involves debridement and repair of any injuries to cartilage and labrum, or recontouring head of femur or the overextended hip bone (acetabulum).\\nLabral tears: Labrum is a covering in the acetabulum which stabilises the hip joint and acts as a shock absorber. Excessive compression forces, or trauma, may damage the labrum and cause pain in the lower back, buttock, knees. Repair is possible by debriding or by stablising it against the hip bone using anchors. Nowadays, grafts are gaining popularity to repair the damaged labrum.\\nBone cysts: The bone cysts are removed and bone graft is filled in place.\\nSynovitis: The inflammation of synovial fluid is removed via synovectomy.\\nArticular cartilage damage: Early stages of arthritis are possible to be treated using this method. 'Microfractures' are made to stimulate growth of new cartilage.\\nThough minimally invasive, hip arthroscopy takes more time than a hip replacement surgery. 2 hours is the average time taken.\\n\\n\\n\""
