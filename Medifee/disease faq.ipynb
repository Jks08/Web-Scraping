      "Reviewed By : Dr. Anjali D.\n",
      "Following are the common questions about Addison's Disease:\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Addison's Disease?\n",
      "What are the causes of Addison's Disease?\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Addison's Disease?\n",
      "What is Adrenal Crisis?\n",
      "What are the diagnostic tests for Addison's Disease?\n",
      "How does your doctor treat Addison's disease?\n",
      "For how long do I have to take the medicines?\n",
      "What to do if a person suddenly arrives at an adrenal crisis state?\n",
      "Can children suffer from Addison's disease?\n",
      "Can Addison's disease be a birth defect?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Addison's Disease? \n",
      "\n",
      "Addison's disease is also known as Adrenal insufficiency and relates to malfunctioning of Adrenal Gland. Just above the kidneys, two adrenal glands are situated, that produce several essential hormones. \n",
      "\n",
      "The adrenal gland can be divided into two parts; Adrenal Cortex (upper portion) and Adrenal Medulla (inner portion). Both these sections produce different classes of hormones; essential for healthy functioning of your body. Medulla produces Adrenalin that regulates various metabolic functions within the body. Cortex on the other hand, produces Glucocorticoids and Mineralocorticoids, along with male sex hormone, Androgen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any damage to the Adrenal Cortex, that results in reduced production of a type of Glucocorticoid known as Cortisol, and a type of Mineralocorticoid known as Aldosterone, is known as Addison's disease. In a nutshell, the failure of the glands to produce these vital hormones is known as Addison's Disease or Hypoadrenalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes of Addison's Disease?\n",
      "Addison's Disease has been divided into two sub sections, depending upon the causes that are causing this adrenal insufficiency. The two types and related causes have been discussed below:\n",
      "Primary Adrenal Insufficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "A condition that arises as an autoimmune disorder. Due to reasons unknown, the immune system functions wrongly and takes Adrenal Cortex as a foreign entity and thus tries inhibiting normal functioning of the gland. Resulting consequence is reduced production of adrenal hormones. \n",
      "Tuberculosis and other infections of the gland may also result in a similar condition\n",
      "Adrenal Cancer mostly relates to reduced production of hormones \n",
      "Bleeding within the adrenal gland may also lead to insufficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "Adrenal Insufficiency resulting due to a pituitary gland malfunction is known as Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency\n",
      "The functions of adrenal glands are controlled by Pituitary Gland secretion. Pituitary Gland produces Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), that stimulates Adrenal Cortex to secrete related hormones. \n",
      "However, any condition that damages your pituitary gland may result in reduced production of ACTH, thus leading to the cortex not receiving sufficient hormones to stimulate it. \n",
      "This condition results in reduced secretion of Cortisol and Aldosterone, even when there is no problem with the adrenal cortex. \n",
      "Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroid drugs to treat conditions such as Asthma or Arthritis may also lead to Cortex malfunction and is also termed as Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Addison's Disease?\n",
      "\n",
      "Addison's disease does not come up with vivid symptoms and therefore does not facilitate early diagnosis. Identifying subtle symptoms and visiting the doctor as soon as these are experienced is crucial.\n",
      "Listed below are some of the early symptoms of Addison's disease:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatigue and a constant feeling of drowsiness \n",
      "Strained and weakened muscles \n",
      "Irritation and depression \n",
      "Reduced appetite \n",
      "Weight loss \n",
      "Frequent need of urinating \n",
      "An increased need of quenching thirst and dehydration \n",
      "Salt Craving \n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms experienced after a few months:\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkening or pigmentation of skin \n",
      "Lips and gums appear to be brownish than usual \n",
      "Low blood pressure leading to frequent episodes of unconsciousness \n",
      "Vomiting and diarrhea \n",
      "Joint pain and muscle cramps \n",
      "Unexplained disinterest in sexual activities. Particularly seen in women. \n",
      "Irregular or reduced menstrual flow in women \n",
      "Low levels of blood sugar \n",
      "Hypothyroidism\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Adrenal Crisis?\n",
      "Adrenal or Addison's Crisis is a condition that refers to acute adrenal insufficiency. During this condition, adrenal glands almost stop producing related hormones, resulting in worsening of above symptoms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adrenal Crisis may lead to coma and even death. Sometimes, adrenal crisis may result in sudden show of severe symptoms and the patient needs to be rushed to a hospital so as to avoid fatal cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the diagnostic tests for Addison's Disease? \n",
      "\n",
      "As above mentioned, the disease does not come up with vivid symptoms that can confirm Adrenal insufficiency. However still, a doctor will definitely discuss symptoms and perform simple physical examinations to look for any hyperpigmentation symptoms or brownish discoloration of gums and lips.\n",
      "Besides this, a doctor will order for the following tests to confirm Addison's disease:\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood Tests to detect Sodium, Potassium and Cortisol levels in body: Sodium and potassium balance is maintained by Mineralocorticoids produced by Cortex. Therefore, abnormal levels show malfunctioning Adrenal Cortex. A report showing low cortisol, high potassium and low sodium confirms Addison's disease. \n",
      "ACTH Stimulation Test: This test is conducted to know levels of ACTH produced and how well the adrenal glands respond to ACTH secretions. \n",
      "Thyroid Function Test and testing for blood sugar levels is also carried out\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How does your doctor treat Addison's disease?\n",
      "Addison's disease is treated with prescribed medicines that make up for the reduced hormone production. These medicines need to be taken regularly. Frequent visits to your doctor for regulating medication is vital. Increased doses may prove otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "Associated problems such as diabetes or thyroid disorders also need to be treated and monitored separately. Early treatment of Addison's disease is crucial to prevent it from turning fatal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For how long do I have to take the medicines?\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the medicines required for Addison's treatment may be required to be taken for a life time. Regular testing and monitoring of medicines is vital. The medication may be changed at times of stress, injury or surgery. Therefore, visiting your doctor after every 4-6 months to know about your adrenal health is always suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What to do if a person suddenly arrives at an adrenal crisis state?\n",
      "It is very much important that you do not allow yourself or anybody else to reach this state of crisis. However, if a person suddenly reaches this state, then make sure that anybody in the family injects corticosteroid doses after doctor consultation. This makes the disease less life threatening. The patient then needs to be rushed to a hospital for proper monitoring and care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can children suffer from Addison's disease?\n",
      "Yes children can also suffer from Addison's disease. This brings about slow growth and late puberty in children who are diagnosed with this adrenal insufficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, correct treatment measures can help to control adverse effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can Addison's disease be a birth defect?\n",
      "Yes. Addison's disease can be a birth defect when you acquire wrong genes from your parents. However, studies are still going on to know more about this condition and how it can be prevented.\n",

      "Response given by our body's immune system to generally harmless substances like dust and grime, pollen, certain foodstuffs etc. by producing antibodies, is termed as allergy. Substances that are responsible for allergies are called allergens; e.g. if you are allergic to dust, then here dust acts as allergen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most of the cases allergies are not a cause of major concern and can be easily cured by medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are types of allergies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Allergies are classified into two categories- IgE mediated and non-IgE mediated.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is IgE mediated allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a type of allergy that responds to specific commonly occurring allergens\n",
      "Mast cells are type of white blood cells which come in contact with external environment; e.g. skin cells, eye cells, nose cells etc. They are associated with immune and neuroimmune system and comprise of heparin and histamine. IgE antibodies are secreted by mast cells in excess quantity that fight against specific allergens.\n",
      "Histamine is an organic nitrogenous compound which acts as a neurotransmitter and is produced by mast cells as immune response to pathogens (foreign bodies)\n",
      "Next time, when the same allergen enters into our body, cells are able to identify it and there are no physical symptoms of an allergy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are symptoms of IgE mediated allergies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary physical symptoms of IgE mediated allergy differ as per the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Release of histamine from mast skin cells results in redness or itchiness of skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Runny nose and sneezing are signs when histamine is released from nose mast cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Non-IgE mediated allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretion of IgE antibodies is absent in this type of allergy. In this type, symptoms appear after a long period of time and if left untreated, may result in severe medical conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is food allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "In food allergy, food acts as an allergen. Our body produces immune response to the certain foodstuff resulting in food allergy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of food allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some enlisted symptoms of food allergy:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vomiting and nausea are the most common symptoms of food allergy\n",
      "Hoarse voice\n",
      "Swelling of tongue or lips\n",
      "Feeling of itchiness in throat, mouth or other areas\n",
      "Fainting\n",

      "Bloating\n",
      "\n",
      "When these symptoms get severe, it results in anaphylaxis.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes food allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Food allergies are generally caused by nuts; especially peanuts. Many children however surpass this allergy when they attain age of five. Walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, cashew nuts and other tree nuts also account for food allergies.\n",
      "Seeds containing oils like sesame seeds, poppy seeds may also prove to be allergens\n",
      "Another common food allergen is milk. Lactose intolerant people usually suffer from milk and other dairy related allergens. Very few of them might be allergic towards beef as it contains some amount of protein that is found in cow milk.\n",
      "Egg is another source of food allergen wherein sensitivity is more towards the white portion of the egg rather than yolk\n",
      "If parents are allergic towards certain foods, chances are that their child will as well be allergic towards that same foodstuff\n",
      "Some people may be allergic towards wheat and wheat products\n",
      "\n",
      "What are home remedies for food allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Home remedies as well as some injections are available to cure food allergies. Depending upon intensity of symptoms, one can opt for either of them. People who are suffering from anaphylaxis (acute allergic reaction) may opt for epinephrine treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are few tips on home remedies for food allergy:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mix 250ml of carrot juice and 100ml each of beetroot juice and cucumber juice and consume it daily at least for a week. This will help in detoxifying and soothe existing allergic conditions.\n",
      "Squeeze half a lemon in a glass of lukewarm water and add a tablespoon of honey to it. Drink this early in the morning on empty stomach. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) present in lemon will help in digestion and honey will provide soothing effect. You may also add few mint leaves to it for further soothing effect.\n",
      "Drinking few cups of green tea added with few drops of lemon and honey may benefit in curing symptoms caused by food allergen.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of precautions should I take to avoid food allergy?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best precautionary advice is to altogether avoid that particular food allergen\n",
      "To know whether you are suffering from certain food allergies, you need to observe how your body reacts to those foodstuffs\n",
      "If your parents are suffering from a certain food allergen, chances are that you might as well be intolerant towards that particular foodstuff. Hence avoiding it can be a precautionary measure.\n",

      "What is Appendix? \n",
      " \n",
      "A blind-ended tube connected to a pouch like structure i.e. cecum, is known as Appendix. It develops from cecum embryologically.  The cecum is a structure of colon which is located at the junction of both intestines (small and large). \n",
      "\n",
      "Where is the Appendix located? \n",
      "\n",
      "The appendix rests on the junction of the small intestine and large intestine. It is a thin tube of approximately four inch length. Normally, the appendix is located in the lower right- hand side of the abdomen. Appendicitis pain may initiate in the middle part of the abdomen. \n",
      " \n",
      "What is the difference between Appendix and Appendicitis? \n",
      "\n",
      "   The appendix is a small, worm-like external body part or an outgrowth attached to the colon. When the appendix gets blocked, Appendicitis occurs. \n",
      "   Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a pouch-shaped organ connected to the large intestine. Without treatment, the appendix can rupture. This can lead to life -threatening situations.  It is recommended to seek medical advise if there are possible symptoms of Appendicitis. \n",

      "   Vomiting\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes of Appendicitis? \n",
      " \n",
      "Causes of appendicitis are unknown in most of the cases. There is possibility of many reasons behind the occurrence of appendicitis. According to medical professionals, an obstruction in the appendix may lead to the appendicitis. Partial and complete obstruction; both can be responsible for the occurrence of appendicitis.  An accumulation of fecal matter may lead to obstruction. The other possible reasons behind the obstruction are listed below:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "   Tumors\n",
      "   Worms\n",
      "   Enlarged lymphoid follicles\n",
      "   Trauma \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "There are chances of multiplication of bacteria inside the organs surrounding the colon when there is obstruction in the appendix. This enhances formation of pus which puts additional pressure and it can be painful. As a result of this process, local blood vessels get compressed and there can be generation of gangrene due to lack of blood flow to appendix. A medical emergency may arise if the appendix rupture takes place and fecal matter can fill into the abdomen.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Appendicitis is diagnosed? \n",
      " \n",
      "After physical examination, the physician may ask for detail symptoms to determine presence of appendicitis. Diagnostic tests recommended for the detection of appendicitis are given below: \n",
      " \n",
      "Abdominal X – ray\n",
      "Barium enema \n",
      "Blood tests to confirm the signs of an infection \n",
      "Urine tests for checking the signs of a UTI or a kidney stone\n",
      "Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to find presence of inflammation of the appendix\n",
      "Laparoscopy\n",
      " \n",
      "Why diagnosis of Appendicitis is difficult? \n",
      " \n",
      "Diagnosis of appendicitis is difficult since the position of appendix in the abdomen may vary. The location of appendix is at the lower right side of abdomen most of the times. Appendix gets attached to the other structures in the abdomen through a sheet-like membrane structure called mesentery. Larger mesentary allows appendix to move around and as a result of this, appendix keeps moving down to the other organs such as pelvis and colon. Because of this,  inflammation of the appendix looks like the inflammation of other organs. Diagnosis of appendicitis can also be difficult when inflammatory problems resemble with it. Right side diverticulitis is an example of it. Since this is the case, patients with possible appendicitis are commonly kept under observation to distinguish between appendicitis and other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "What is Stump Appendicitis? \n",
      " \n",
      "Post operation, there is a possibility that, small portion of appendix may remain behind. There are chances of inflammation of this remaining piece of appendix and it can lead to further complications of appendicitis. Hence, it is possible to observe recurrence of appendicitis in case of patients who have previously undergone appendicitis surgery. \n",
      "Stump appendicitis is acute inflammation of the residual appendix which mostly occurs after laparoscopic appendectomy. It results from obstruction of the lumen of appendix which is left behind post surgery in some cases. Since there is possibility of rupture of stump as a result of insufficient diagnosis and treatment, early diagnosis is recommended.\n",
      " \n",
      "How Appendicitis is treated? \n",
      " \n",
      "Based on the diagnosis, need of surgical treatments is decided. Antibiotics are recommended prior to the surgery in most of the cases. Medication helps prevent post-operative infections. Surgical removal of appendix is known as Appendectomy. Based on the severity of appendicitis, open appendectomy or a laparoscopic appendectomy is performed. \n",
      " \n",
      "What is an Open Appendectomy? \n",
      " \n",
      "An incision in the lower right side of the abdomen is made by the surgeon during an open appendectomy. Appendix is removed and wound is closed with the aid of stitches. During this process, abdominal cavity can be cleaned in case of appendix burst inside the abdomen. \n",
      " \n",
      "What is Laparoscopic Appendectomy? \n",
      " \n",
      "As the name indicates, this surgery involves use of laparoscope. Few small incisions are made in the abdomen and laparoscope is inserted into these incisions during the surgery. A laparoscope is a long and thin tube having camera on the front side. Images of the abdominal area can be displayed on the screen which helps in observing abdomen and performing surgery using the instruments. After finding the appendix, it is tied with the aid of stitches and then removed.  After this, dressing and cleaning processes are performed.\n",
      " \n",
      "How Appendicitis can be prevented? \n",
      " \n",
      "Appendicitis cannot be prevented as such, but there are some precautions which can reduce its risk. There is less frequency of occurrence of appendicitis in the people with high fiber diet. A healthy diet containing fresh vegetables and fruits is helpful in increasing fiber intake. Timely medical advice is recommended, since untreated appendicitis can lead to medical emergency. \n",
      " \n",
      "What are the complications of Appendicitis?? \n",
      " \n",
      "Perforation is the most frequently generated complication of appendicitis. It can lead to a Peri-appendiceal abscess which is collection of infected pus. This occurs as a result of delaying the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis. If there is no improvement after the use of antibiotics in the patients of appendicitis, surgical treatment needs to be initiated without delay to avoid further complications. \n",
      "A comparatively common complication of appendicitis is blockage or obstruction of the intestine. Compression of intestine because of the inflammation surrounding the appendix causes blockage. This blockage restricts the passage of intestinal contents. If the intestinal area above the blockage gets filled with liquid and gas, swelling of abdomen takes place and further results in nausea and vomiting. Therefore, it becomes necessary to remove the contents of the intestine using a tube passed through esophagus and nose and into the stomach and intestine.\n",
      "Which conditions can mimic Appendicitis? \n",
      "Below are some conditions that can mimic appendicitis even when it is not actually present.\n",
      " \n",

      "What is Arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthritis is a condition that refers to a group of joint diseases that result in severe pain and related discomforts. It is an inflammatory condition affecting joints in any part of your body. Body joints are protected by soft tissues known as cartilages. A fluid known as synovium flows through the joints and cartilages and lubricates them as needed. However, multiple factors that damage cartilages or the fluid expose joints to sudden shock or pressure. And this is what is known as arthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, an external infection, autoimmune condition affecting joints, other health issues having detrimental effect on joints can lead to a condition of excessive joint pain or arthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is arthritis curable?\n",
      "\n",
      "NO. Arthritis becomes a life long trouble once developed and is not curable completely. However, treatments, diet and positive lifestyle changes can help to reduce severity of symptoms to a great extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many types of arthritis are there?\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, there are more than 100 different type of arthritis. However, few of the common forms are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoarthritis\n",
      "Rheumatoid Arthritis\n",
      "Juvenile Arthritis\n",
      "Septic Arthritis\n",
      "Psoriatic arthritis\n",
      "Reactive arthritis\n",
      "Gout\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Gout?\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals having high levels of Uric acid in body tend to develop some crystal like structure inside joints. This condition is known as gout. Men remain more prone to gout as compared to women. Knees, ankles and toes are mostly affected with gout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kidney troubles make people be at high risk of gout. Therefore , opting for timely kidney function tests and also knowing your uric acid levels can help prevent this disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gout is slightly different from other forms of arthritis as the symptoms are periodic - they come and go. Gout is characterized by swelling, redness and itching around the affected area. The skin also appears slightly shiny during gout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can gout affect your shoulder region?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, gout can very well affect your neck. Although gout is first diagnosed around your toes, feet or ankle, elevated levels of uric acid may develop similar crystals around neck and thus cause gout in the neck and shoulder region as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is rheumatoid arthritis different from osteoarthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoarthritis mostly relates to that condition where bone joint troubles arise due to cartilage damage. Rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune mechanism is abnormally altered and thus attacks the body joints and tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both these types however relate to family history. If any one in your family suffers from arthritis, you may also develop the disease at some point of time. However, osteoarthritis is more related to aging. Most patient who suffer from arthritis actually suffer from osteoarthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obesity and poor life style also impact your joints negatively, causing any of the two forms of arthritis. A pathogenic infection may sometimes be a reason behind Rheumatoid Arthritis, if the immune system is adversely affected during any microbial infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following are few of the common symptoms experienced with osteoarthritis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Painful sensation experienced deep within bones\n",
      "Difficulty in carrying away usual day to day activities - climbing stairs, sitting and standing etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following are few of the common symptoms experienced with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n",
      "\n",
      "The most distinguishable feature of rheumatoid arthritis is that it affects in pairs. This means that it will affect both your feet, ankles hands and wrists.\n",
      "Unexplained weight loss\n",
      "A feeling of fullness and lack of appetite\n",
      "Joints are swollen due to fluid accumulation and may appear red\n",

      "Sensitive joints\n",
      "\n",
      "Can children suffer from arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, children may also suffer from arthritis, known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis affecting children is said to cause juvenile arthritis. Children born with this autoimmune condition, start showing symptoms at very tender age or early adolescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you know if your child is suffering from arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Limping\n",
      "Slow development\n",
      "Children who can walk may prefer crawling\n",
      "Vision trouble may also be observed\n",
      "Complaints of regular joint pain that may even swell up\n",
      "\n",
      "How is hepatitis related to arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Septic arthritis is caused by bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore, hepatitis in any form, makes people very susceptible to develop this form of arthritis at later stages. Septic arthritis affects one single bone at a time. Mostly knee and hip bones are affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can autoimmune skin disorders lead to arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, people suffering from psoriasis can develop psoriatic arthritis at later stages. Factors that lead to psoriasis can bring about joint problems, if not treated at early stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is spondylitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Spinal arthritis is known as spondylitis. Men and women equally are susceptible to develop spondylitis. It is characterized by prolonged pain around lower back, hip and shoulders. Extreme stiffness is accompanied by the pain that does not disappear within 3 months. Spondylitis is mostly hereditary. Therefore, if you have family members suffering from spine arthritis, taking prior precaution in the form of exercises is mandatory. However, always discuss this with your doctor before you start with any exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does you doctor confirm arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone and joint disorder can raise similar symptoms. Therefore, diagnostic tests become mandatory to confirm arthritis and rule out other bone disorders. A doctor usually orders an X ray, CT Scan, MRI Scan etc., post physical examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hepatitis A, B or C tests can also be performed in case of septic arthritis. Other blood tests and genetic markers may be opted as and when need arises.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options for arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "As already mentioned, arthritis can never be completely cured. However, treatment to reduce severity of symptoms and prevent further damage is very much available. Arthritis of any form has three treatment aspects: Medication, Surgery and Lifestyle changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medication - Doctors mostly prescribe a set of medicines when patients are detected with arthritis in any form. These medicines aim at reducing severity of symptoms and allowing patients to carry on with normal activities without much hindrance. However, regular monitoring of these prescribed drugs is crucial to avoid unwanted consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgery - At worst cases where medication and lifestyle changes are not bringing about required results, surgical treatment needs to be opted for. Knee replacement surgery, Hip replacement surgeries etc., are being performed on a regular basis in various health care centers across cities in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life style changes - A lot can be achieved if proper life style and dietary changes can be adopted. Physical exercises as recommended by doctor, diet to improve bone and joint health, reduced stress levels etc., can all contribute in treating arthritis to a great extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "What should you eat if suffering from arthritis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following are recommended food items that must be a part of your diet plan while treating arthritis:\n",

      "\n",
      "Aging: Increasing age is the most risky cause for development of breast cancer. Almost 3/4th cases occurring are seen for individuals aged more than 50.\n",
      "Inheritance: Family history is an indicator for being affected by breast cancer. However, it is also true that most individuals developing breast cancer don't have family history for this ailment.\n",
      "Overweight: Overweight is also a risk for breast cancer development. Women who are overweight are most  likely to develop this cancer post menopause.\n",
      "Alcohol consumption: Consuming more than 2 standard measures of alcohol per day will accentuate risk for breast cancer development.\n",
      "HRT (Hormone replacement therapy): Some women opt for HRT post menopause in continuity for over 5 years. The risk for breast cancer may increase due to this; however, it will vary with different women.\n",
      "Oral contraceptive: Women taking oral contraceptives have a small breast cancer risk associated with it.\n",
      "Child birth: Having kids at early age lowers the risk for breast cancer. However, women who have kids late and those who never try for having a child are at high risk for breast cancer development.\n",

      "Stage 0: This stage describes breast cancers that are non-invasive. In this stage, no evidence about abnormal non-cancerous cells or cancer cells is found. No sign about cells invading or getting through normal tissues is visible during this stage.\n",
      "Stage 1: This stage describes about invasive breast cancer. Cancer cells break through or invade surrounding normal breast tissue during such a state. Microscopic invasion becomes possible during this stage. During microscopic invasion, cancer cells just begin invading tissues present outside duct lining or lobule; however, the measure of these invading cells cannot be over 1 millimeter.\n",
      "Stage 2: During this stage the cancer is considered to be in its earlier stages; however, evidence about the cancer beginning to grow or even spread is present during this stage. The cancer is still confined to breast area and can be treated effectively.\n",
      "Stage 3: This is considered as the advanced stage and the cancer extends beyond immediate tumor region. It might invade nearby muscles and lymph nodes; however, it cannot spread to the distant organs. Though being advanced, breast cancer in this stage can be treated effectively with latest methods.\n",
      "Stage 4: During this stage, breast cancer spreads to different body regions such as bones, liver, lungs and brain. Though this stage is said to be incurable, advancements in recent times have ensured that treatments are made available to increase the life of patients for some more years than was possible previously.\n",

      "Limiting alcohol intake: Limiting alcohol intake to less than a drink every day will significantly reduce risk of breast cancer.\n",
      "Avoid smoking: Especially women who have not reached menopause need to avoid smoking to keep themselves away from breast cancer.\n",
      "Control weight: Being obese or even overweight increases breast cancer risk. This is especially true for women after menopause.\n",
      "Physical activity: Adequate physical activity ensures healthy weight and also reduces breast cancer risk.\n",
      "Breast feeding: Breast feeding for longer duration creates a protective field for breast cancer.\n",
      "Limit hormone therapy: Limiting hormone therapy to less than 5 years is good to keep breast cancer at bay.\n",
      "Avoid radiation exposure along with environmental pollution: High radiation dose needs to be avoided as far as possible to reduce breast cancer risk.\n",

      "What is Bronchitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronchitis is the inflammation or swelling of the bronchi (bronchial tubes), the passageway that supplies air to lungs\n",
      "Bronchi are the main airways to lungs which branch off to smaller tubes called as bronchioles. The walls of bronchi create mucus to trap dust and other irritants.\n",
      "The lining of bronchial tubes becomes infected, swells and closes up the small air ways to the lung. This leads to coughing fits, accompanied with mucus and shortness of breath.\n",
      "This disease decreases the ability of a person to breathe in air as there is heavy mucus or phlegm formation in the passages.\n",
      "There are two types of bronchitis:\n",
      "   Acute Bronchitis:\n",
      "           \n",
      "           This type lasts for one to three weeks \n",
      "           It is responsible for a hacking cough and follows a cold or viral infection, such as  flu\n",
      "           It consists of a cough with mucus, chest discomfort, fever and breathlessness\n",
      "           \n",
      "         Chronic Bronchitis:\n",
      "           \n",
      "           It lasts longer than three months and is characterized by a chronic cough along with mucus\n",
      "           People having this ailment, suffer from breathing difficulties\n",
      "           Symptoms may get better or worse, according to seasons of the year\n",
      "           Chronic Bronchitis is one type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A lot of mucus is produced by the inflamed bronchial tubes. This leads to coughing and breathing problems.\n",
      "           It is a long standing condition and is never cured completely\n",
      "           \n",
      "        \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes of Bronchitis?\n",
      "Causes of acute bronchitis:\n",
      "\n",
      "90% caused by viral infections, originating in the lungs. These viruses are typically associated with common cold and flu.\n",
      "The virus comes out in tiny droplets from the nose and the mouth, when someone sneezes. This virus can live for up to 24 hours.\n",
      "Infections caused by bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis\n",
      "Tobacco smoke, vapors, dust, fumes and air pollution, irritates the lungs and leads to this form of bronchitis\n",
      "\n",
      "Causes of chronic bronchitis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Repeated irritation of the lung passages cause damage to the pulmonary tissue and the tubes\n",
      "Smoking is the most common cause\n",
      "Long-term exposure to air pollution and dust in the environment\n",
      "Recurring episodes of acute bronchitis\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Bronchitis?\n",
      "For both acute and chronic bronchitis, the symptoms are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hacking cough\n",
      "Production of mucus which can be white, yellow or green phlegm, after a period of 24 to 48 hours, after the cough begins\n",
      "Fever accompanied with chills\n",
      "Discomfort in the chest\n",
      "Difficulty in breathing\n",
      "Fatigue\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For acute bronchitis, a nagging cough persists; long after the inflammation itself resolves. For chronic bronchitis, the cough lasts for more than three months, with short bouts occurring repeatedly, for two years. There will be some spells that are worse than others. At such times, acute bronchitis occurs on top of the chronic bronchitis.\n",
      "A doctor should be consulted when the cough:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasts for over three weeks\n",
      "Interferes with sleep\n",
      "Is accompanied by a fever of over 100.4°F\n",
      "Leads to expelling grayish-green mucus\n",
      "Produces blood\n",
      "Leads to breathlessness\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the tests suggested for diagnosing bronchitis?\n",
      "Firstly, the doctor performs a thorough physical examination along with a review of  medical history of the patient. He or she may ask various questions about the cough, like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Length of time since it started\n",
      "What is expelled\n",
      "How long the fit lasts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a definite diagnosis, the tests performed are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary Function testing: A Spirometer is used and the patient is asked to breathe into it. A spirometer is a device which measures the volume of the lungs and how quickly the air can be expelled from it. The test is used to check for emphysema or asthma and the functioning of the lungs.\n",
      "Chest X-ray: Helps to confirm whether the cough is due to pneumonia or some other condition. This is normally done for smokers; current or had been in the past.\n",
      "High Resolution Computed Tomography(HRCT): This is a type of CT scan which creates a high quality image of the lungs. It is like any other CT scan that takes only a few minutes to perform.\n",
      "Sputum tests: Sputum is the mucus which is coughed up. Examination of cells in the sputum can help \tin diagnosis of some of the lung problems. It can be tested for whooping cough (pertussis) or such diseases that can be cured with antibiotics. The sputum can also be tested for allergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the lab values of tests required for bronchitis?\n",
      "The value of FEV1/FVC ratio is used to determine bronchitis. FEV1(Forced expiratory volume) is the volume of air forcefully exhaled in 1 sec. FVC(Forced vital capacity) is the maximum volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled (contains FEV1 inside it). When the ratio is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Greater than 80%= minimal obstructive defect\n",
      "65-80%= mild obstructive defect\n",
      "50-65%=moderate obstructive defect\n",
      "Less than 50%= severe obstructive defect\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the costs of bronchitis tests in India?\n",
      "The costs of bronchitis tests in India may vary depending on various factors such as, the severity of the condition, city of residence, hospital or diagnostic center where the test is being performed. To get an extensive list of the cost of tests in hospitals or diagnostic testing centers in a specific city, click here.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment methods for bronchitis?\n",
      "Acute Bronchitis treatment does not usually require a General Practitioner (GP) and can be \tovercome by home remedies. Chronic bronchitis cannot be cured, but a healthy style of \tliving can help. Smoking should be stopped as it worsens the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home Remedies\n",
      "  \n",
      "Plenty of rest should be taken\n",
      "Intake of fluids should be increased as it helps in thinning of the mucus. This can help in coughing up the sputum and also prevents dehydration.\n",
      "Aches and pains, headaches and fever can be relieved by over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen and paracetamol. However, ibuprofen should be avoided by people with asthma.\n",
      "Smoke and fumes should be avoided\n",
      "Vaporizers should be used\n",
      "Inhaling steam to clear blocked passages\n",
      "Bronchodilators: They can be used for immediate relief. It helps in opening up passageways of the lungs and are generally used by asthma patients.\n",
      "Cough syrups can be taken to soothe the throat, but it should not be given to children below six. If the cough is disruptive, that is, it wakes a person up at night due to incessant coughing, then a cough suppressant can be taken.\n",
      "As an alternative to taking cough medicines, a mixture of honey and lemon can be used to give relief to sore throat and help the cough to subside\n",
      "  \n",
      "Smoking: It inflames lungs and worsens the condition. It can lead to the chronic form of bronchitis. So it gives an ideal opportunity to give up smoking altogether.\n",
      "Antibiotics: These are not required for people with normal lungs and no health conditions. In most cases it is a virus and antibiotics are ineffective. Normally for acute bronchitis, it is not necessary to consult a G.P, but in some cases a doctor should be visited.\n",
      "\tIn these cases, the G.P may prescribe antibiotics. Mainly, when there is risk of developing \tpneumonia.  Antibiotics are advised for:\n",
      "\n",
      "  People who have crossed the age of eighty\n",
      "Prematurely born babies\n",
      "People with a history of lung, kidney, liver or heart condition\n",
      "People having weak immune systems, caused by an undiagnosed disease or side effects of medication like steroids\n",
      "People with an inherited condition called as cystic fibrosis, where the lungs and  stomach become choked with a thick, sticky mucus\n",
      "  \n",
      "Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed as bronchitis is normally caused by virus and has no \timpact on it. If antibiotics are prescribed without being necessary, then the bacteria might \tgrow stronger and grow resistant to that antibiotic.\n",
      "\n",
      "If antibiotic is prescribed, then it will usually be a course for five days of:\n",
      "\n",
      "Doxycycline\n",
      "Oxytetracycline\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For Chronic Bronchitis:\n",
      "\n",
      "The lungs are prone to infections. After consultation with a doctor, the following steps should be taken:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  An annual flu shot\n",
      "  Pneumonia vaccination: A pneumonia vaccine called as PPSV23 is effective against the common bacterial pneumonia till the age of 65. After that, a booster shot may be required as well as a\tshot for a different form of bacteria. If there is any other medical condition, the booster may be required sooner.\n",
      "  \n",
      "For chronic bronchitis, over-the-counter cough syrups should be avoided. Productive coughing (that is coughing leading to expelling mucus), is helpful for the body to get rid of excess phlegm from the lungs. An expectorant may be prescribed if the phlegm is not easy to get rid of.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the mucus is increasing or there is an increase in its thickness, there may be a bacterial infection. Then the G.P prescribes a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a wide range of bacteria, for a 5 to 10 day course. Overweight people may be put on a diet to avoid overstraining the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a person has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), following treatment is given:\n",
      " \n",
      "  An Anticholinergic bronchodilator, to dilate the constricted passage ways of the lungs\n",
      "  Steroids to reduce the inflammation of the passages\n",
      "  \n",
      "Giving up smoking is the best and most effective way to cure chronic bronchitis, as well as COPD\n",
      "\n",
      "For chronic bronchitis and COPD, ability of the body to transfer oxygen from the lungs to bloodstream is reduced. For this, oxygen therapy may be prescribed on a continuous basis or, as and when required.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the preventive measures to adopt for avoiding bronchitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoking should be stopped as it damages the lungs. By stopping, the lungs will begin to heal and coughing will stop. This will enable the person to breathe better. Even second hand smoke should be kept away from.\n",
      "Aerosol products like hairspray, deodorant spray and spray paint should be avoided\n",
      "Chemical fumes and dust should be avoided\n",
      "While using anything with strong fumes, like varnish, paint and paint remover, a mask should be worn over the nose and mouth\n",
      "Washing hands often can kill a lot of viruses and bacteria\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Where colon is located in the human body?\n",
      "The last part of the digestive system is the colon. It is also known as large intestine.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Colon cancer? \n",
      "Colon cancer is developed from colon or rectum. It is also known as colorectal or bowel cancer. It generates from the abnormal growth of cells having the ability to spread around inside the body. Almost all types of colon cancers initiate in the lining of the colon and rectum.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Colorectal cancer?\n",
      "Colon cancer is not necessarily similar to the rectal cancer. Both of them often occur together and known as colorectal cancer. The Colon cancer is the cancer of large intestine often known as colorectal cancer. Rectal cancer originates in the rectum, which is close to the anus.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes Colon cancer?\n",
      "There are many risk factors responsible for the generation of colon cancer. These include high fat intake, male gender, old age, obesity, consumption of red and processed meat, high alcohol consumption and lack of body movements. Insufficient activity is also one of the causes of colon cancer in some cases. Inflammatory bowel disease patients are prone to get colorectal cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which are the early warning signs of Colon cancer?\n",
      "The classic early warning signs of Colon cancer include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood in the stool\n",
      "Worsening constipation\n",
      "Decrease in the thickness of stool\n",
      "Loss of appetite\n",

      "Prolonged tiredness\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the role of genetics in Colon cancer?\n",
      "There are chances of having genetic birth defects which make one susceptible to cancer during some phase of life. Family history is a risk factor in occurrence of Colon cancer. It has been reported that people with family history of Colon cancer in two or more first degree relatives i.e., parents or siblings, are at high risk of this disease.\n",
      "Genetic syndromes associated with colorectal cancer are given below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome \n",
      "Gardner syndrome\n",
      "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n",
      "Metastatic disease is a severe condition which may lead to death when associated with colon cancer. The hepatocyte growth factor gets influenced by a transitional factor which is a gene called MACC1. This gene is responsible for occurrence of metastatic disease. Certain epigenetic factors like abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppression promoters are responsible for generation of colorectal cancer. \n",
      "\n",
      "What is the prognosis in case of Colon cancer?\n",
      "It is possible for colorectal cancer patients to live a normal life. Though there is availability of treatments with positive outcomes, combination of treatments may be needed for prevention of recurrence of the cancer. Combination of treatments may involve chemotherapy, radiation and surgical methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which tests are used to diagnose Colon cancer?\n",
      "Even before the symptoms develop, colon cancer can be detected with the aid of screening tests. This is possible in the most curable stage of cancer. Rectal examination helps detecting only rectal cancer and not the colon cancer. Tests used for colon cancer diagnosis are discussed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy - Colonoscopy is the best screening test for  colon cancer diagnosis. This is carried out for evaluation of cause behind the presence of blood in stool. The entire colon can be seen only with the help of full Colonoscopy.\n",
      "Blood tests performed for the diagnosis of colon cancer are given below:\n",
      "Fecal occult blood test - Detection of small quantity of blood can be done using Fecal occult blood test (FOBT).\n",
      "Complete blood count (CBC) for the detection of anemia\n",
      "Liver function tests Once colon cancer is diagnosed, further tests are required to confirm the stage of the cancer. For stage determination, CT or MRI scans of abdomen, chest, brain as well as pelvic area are carried out.\n",
      "There are following stages of cancer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Stage 0 – Early cancer in the innermost intestinal layer\n",
      "Stage I – Cancer in the inner layer of colon\n",
      "Stage II – Spread of cancer though muscle wall of colon\n",
      "Stage III – Spread of cancer to the lymph nodes\n",
      "Stage IV – Spread of cancer to the organs outside the colon \n",
      "\n",
      "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) – This is a blood test used for detection of tumor markers. This is useful during the colon cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Colon cancer is treated?\n",
      "Treatment of colon cancer depends on many things, including the stage of the cancer. Treatments may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgical methods\n",
      "Chemotherapy \n",
      "Radiation therapy\n",
      "Targeted therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgical methods:Stage 0 colon cancer can be treated by surgical removal of tumor. This is mostly carried out using Colonoscopy. Expensive surgical treatments are required for stage I, II and III cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is recommended for stage III colon cancer after surgery for the duration of more than 6 months.  This treatment is known as adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is continued for certain period after surgical removal of cancerous growth for treating remaining cancer cells if any.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation therapy: This therapy is used along with chemotherapy for stage III rectal cancer patients. For treating cancerous growth spread to the liver, treatment can be directed at the liver. This involves Ablation (burning the cancer), chemotherapy or radiation application \tdirectly into the liver and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeted therapy:As the name suggests, this therapy acts on specific targets in cancer cells. The drug disables the cancerous cells to avoid their growth further. Targeted surgery can be used along with other types of treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is survival rate in Colon cancer patients?\n",
      "Based on the extent of cancer observed during diagnosis and its recovery, survival rate can be decided. Response to the treatment may vary from person to person.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are benefits of Colorectal cancer screening?\n",
      "Screening involves process of finding the presence of cancer or pre-cancer signs in the patients. The most powerful way to fight against cancer in early stages is regular colorectal screening. According to medical literature, screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) helps in reducing CRC mortality rate. \n",

      "What are the causes of constipation?\n",
      "What are the symptoms of constipation?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is constipation?\n",
      "The word constipation is derived from Latin word “constipare” which means clump together. Person suffering from constipation finds it difficult to pass stools and empty bowels. He/she may experience infrequent bowel movements. It is related to digestive system and excretory system. If stools are not emptied on time, they become hard. \n",
      "Severe constipation leads to obstipation and fecal impaction. Obstipation is failure to pass gases and stools and fecal impaction is immobile, solid bulk of feces that gets accumulated in rectum. Bowel obstruction can become fatal if left treated. \n",
      "Constipation is a symptom that shows there is some problem with digestion and excretory system. It is not a disease. It is a common symptom and every individual suffers from constipation at least once in his lifetime. \n",
      "What are the types of constipation?\n",
      "Constipation can be divided into two types- obstructed defecation and Colonic Inertia (slow transit).\n",
      "\n",
      "Obstructed defecation results because of functional and mechanical causes of digestive and excretory system.\n",
      "Colonic Inertia (slow transit) results because of hormonal disorders like hypothyroidism, diet, metal toxicity, side effects of medications etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes of constipation?\n",
      "Causes of constipation can be attributed to various factors such as diet, excessive medication, lack of exercise, etc. Let us see each of these causes in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diet: Diet plays a major role in effective bowel flow. Genetically modified foods, addition of GMO's, processed foods, high intake of salt and sugar, consuming too much of coffee and tea, excess alcohol etc., have serious effects on digestion.  All these foods hinder the process of digestion and interfere with nutrient absorption in bloodstream. \n",
      "Diet low in fiber is another major cause of constipation. Insufficient consumption of fibrous foods leads to accumulation of waste products in the gastrointestinal tract or in the colon. \n",
      "Consuming too much of dairy products can cause constipation in people who are lactose-intolerant. Lactose is a sugar that is present in milk and dairy products. \n",
      "Lack of fluids: Dehydration or lack of water molecules in body results in constipation. If you do not drink enough water, toxic materials remain in body and their accumulation can give rise to various diseases; constipation being one of them. Please note that drinking aerated drinks or sodas do not count as fluids. They do more harm to the body than any good.\n",
      "Lack of exercise: Lack of exercise decreases your metabolic rate, makes your body lethargic and interferes in secretion of gastrointestinal juices that help in digestion. \n",
      "Excessive medication: Excessive medication interferes with function of kidney and can cause various kidney disorders. Medications are necessary, but frequent heavy dose of painkillers, vitamin and mineral supplements, protein supplements etc., reduces effectiveness of kidney function and this leads to accumulation of unfiltered waste in parts of kidney. Such situation can be fatal and may even lead to kidney failure. Hence, it is very important to take medications after consulting with doctor. Too much of protein is like an enemy for kidney. \n",
      "Stress: Stress is another major culprit of constipation. You can observe that the days when you are happy and stress-free, your bowels are easily emptied. But, when you are under tension and stress, your stomach is unhappy and hormonal imbalance leads to digestive problems.\n",
      "Age: Aging reduces efficiency of digestive system. It is not that easy for the intestines to digest food as they used to do earlier in young age. \n",
      "Frequent heavy meals, fried and spicy items also cause indigestion. Red meats and raw foods are difficult to digest and if not digested properly lead to accumulation of wastes.\n",
      "Pregnancy can also cause temporary constipation problems. \n",
      "Consuming foods in wrong combinations like meat and milk etc., can cause food poisoning and may result in hard bowel movements.\n",
      "Structural and functional abnormalities of excretory system and digestive system, anal cancer, Parkinson disease, anal fissures etc., can cause constipation. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of constipation?\n",
      "Constipation is a sign that your body is communicating with you to tell that there is something wrong with excretory system. These signs should not be ignored, otherwise they will advance further and affect your overall health. Common indications of constipation are mentioned below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Infrequent bowel movements\n",
      "Painful bowel movements\n",
      "Feeling of bowels not getting emptied completely\n",
      "Small or hard stools\n",
      "Swelling in abdomen\n",
      "Water retention \n",
      "Feeling sluggish and uncomfortable\n",
      "\n",
      "How is constipation diagnosed?\n",
      "If you have been facing trouble of emptying bowels since more than two weeks, perhaps its time to visit your doctor. It's better to not delay your appointment with doctor as it may further increase your problems. Diagnostic tests for constipation includes blood test (Thyroid Test) and colonoscopy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Blood test (Thyroid Test) is done to determine hormone levels in body\n",
      "Colonoscopy is a test used to determine blockages in colon. \n",
      "\n",
      " What are home remedies for constipation?\n",
      "You can opt for home remedies for at least a week to cure constipation. If symptoms exist even after two weeks, it is better to consult with a doctor. \n",
      "Here are some home remedies enlisted:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink a glass of lukewarm water every morning after you wake up. Squeeze in some fresh lemon juice and add few tablespoons of honey in lukewarm water. Consuming this drink on empty stomach every morning, helps in relieving constipation. Lemon juice stimulates bowel movements whereas honey gives instant energy. You may even add a pinch of red pepper powder to this drink. \n",
      "You may even consume triphala powder before going to bed. Triphala is an ayurvedic medicine for indigestion and consists of amla powder, beheda powder and hirda powder. You will experience the power of this ayurvedic medicine next morning.  These ingredients facilitate bowel movement and help to flush out toxins from the body. \n",
      "Include as much as salad possible in your diet. Cucumber, lettuce, raw veggies, tomatoes, melons, carrots etc. are all good sources of fiber. Chia seeds, flax seeds, lentils, oats and prunes help in aiding digestion process. Soaked raisins act as mild laxative and can provide some relief to constipation patients. Fiber helps in regulating bowel movements; thereby keeping colon clean. Roughage or fiber is not digested by our body and thus is of zero nutritional value to our body. But, it is one of the most important component of balanced diet as it helps in excreting waste products from body by regulating bowel movements.\n",
      "Grease your intestines. It implies adequate consumption of oil and ghee. Ghee activates production of hydrochloric acid (HCL) in stomach and aids in digestion. Consume at least teaspoon of extra virgin oil or any nut based cold pressed oil to reap maximum benefits. Oils help in moisturizing digestive tract and helps in absorption of vitamins and minerals into bloodstream.\n",
      "Baking soda can come to your rescue in terms of constipation. Baking soda is scientifically known as sodium bicarbonate.  When it reacts with hydrochloric acid present in stomach, it forms salts, carbon-dioxide and water as byproducts.  This accelerates bowel movement and cleanses colon. \n",
      "Increase your fluid intake. If you get bored of consuming normal water, you can add some taste or flavor to it by infusing some lemon juice, ginger juice, mint leaves, basil leaves etc. Basil leaves add a beautiful flavor and aroma to water. Sugarcane juice, coconut water, cold milk, fruit and vegetable juices are good options to keep your body hydrated. \n",
      "Green tea is another option that will help you to cleanse your system. Also, green tea is available in various flavors such as mint, ginger, honey, lemon, etc. Regular consumption of green tea will not only help in constipation, but also increase metabolic rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "What precautions can I take to avoid constipation?\n",
      "Constipation is not an overnight symptom. Maintaining healthy lifestyle and being in synchrony with nature can prevent occurrence of constipation. Here are some precautionary measures enlisted below that can keep constipation at bay:\n",
      "\n",
      "Strictly avoid colas and soft drinks. Aerated drinks are a big no for health and prove hazardous; especially  in times of constipation. Alcohol should also be consumed in limited quantity. \n",
      "Avoid over consumption of dairy products. Eat balanced diet with correct proportion of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and fiber. \n",
      "Quit smoking altogether\n",
      "Alcohol and caffeine dehydrates body\n",
      "Visit washroom whenever you feel the urge. Do not suppress your urine as it exerts undue pressure over bladder. \n",
      "Regular exercise increases rate of metabolism. Increased rate of metabolism  accelerates speed of digestion. \n",
      "As you age, avoid consumption of red meat. Red meat is hard to digest and with increasing age, digestive capacity diminishes slowly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Which over the counter laxatives are available to treat constipation?\n",
      "Over the counter laxatives are used as last option for treatment. Consult with doctor before taking these laxatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stimulants: Stimulants include Correctol, Senokot and Dulcolax. These stimulants work on stomach muscles and control their action.\n",
      "Lubricants: Lubricants include mineral oil and fleet. They enable easy bowel movements through colon.\n",
      "Stool softeners: Colace and surfak are two stool softeners that help in re-hydrating stool. \n",
      "Fiber supplements: Fiber supplements are also called as bulk laxatives and are one of the most safest options. FiberCon, Metamucil, Konsyl, Serutan and Citrucel are some of fiber supplements. Note that you will have to consume plenty of water after taking these supplements. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can ayurveda help to cure constipation?\n",
      "Ayurveda is ancient medicinal science that has been practiced in India since ages and whose effectiveness is highly regarded. Ayurveda perceives constipation as over secretion or under secretion of vata (cold). This makes the colon dry and eventually cause constipation. It can be balanced by consuming foods that provide warmth to body. Below are few ayurvedic solutions that can provide some relief in constipation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink lot of warm water or hot water. Warm water activates metabolism activity and improves process of digestion. It also helps in balancing vata's cold quality.\n",
      "Drink herbal tea with infusion of ginger juice, lemon grass and basil. This combination keeps body warm and helps in digestion. \n",
      "Do not be over-conscious when consuming organic oils. Yes, oils do have lot of calories in them, but are indispensable for health. Oils grease digestive track, cleanse colon and increase effectiveness of vitamin and mineral absorption. Also remember that fatty acids present in oils are important to dissolve vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin K. Without the presence of fatty acids, these vitamins become of no use to the body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin C and Vitamin B-Complex group are water soluble vitamins. Drinking two tablespoons of organic or cold pressed castor oil cleanses colon more effectively than any other oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ayurveda suggests to drink warm milk with few drops of ghee before bedtime. This drink not only induces sound sleep, but also nourishes tissues of digestive system.\n",
      "Triphala can be consumed in the form of tablet or powder. It is an ayurvedic medicine for constipation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The above mentioned tips if followed regularly, help to keep digestive tract healthy in long run.\n",
      "Which yoga poses help in digestion?\n",
      "Yoga has its origins in India and has been practiced by sages. Yoga connects mind and body. Practice of yoga should not be limited to few days, but it should be converted into lifestyle. We have enlisted few yoga positions that help to boost digestion process:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarvangasana\n",
      "Vajrasana\n",
      "Trikonasana\n",
      "Janusirsasana\n",
      "Bhujangasana\n",
      "Balasana\n",
      "\n",
      "What is constipation in children?\n",
      "Problem of constipation in babies and children is common. A child suffering from constipation passes irregular and hard stool. Breast milk fed baby is less likely to suffer from constipation than bottle-fed (infant formula) baby. Breast milk is easily digestible and contains enzymes that protect baby from diarrhea. \n",
      "A new born baby may pass stool with every feed. Some babies may not pass stool for over a week. This is absolutely normal and is not cause of any concern.\n",
      "Poor appetite, irritating and unhappy behavior, tummy ache are few common symptoms that a constipated child will exhibit. If child does not empty bowels for more than a week, you should consult with doctor to understand the exact cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important that parents inculcate healthy eating habits in their children since childhood. These habits are carried on in future and help your child evolve into a healthy individual.\n",
      "Colors appeal to children and putting healthy, multicolored food on plate will make it irresistible for child to devour.\n",
      "Generally, children follow their parents. If parents themselves eat unhealthy stuff, children may as well unconsciously follow the same habit. Hence, parents should take care of what they are putting into their mouth.\n",
      "What is the cost of treatment for constipation?\n",
      "Cost of treatment for constipation depends on the type of treatment suggested by the doctor. Treatment is usually in the form of medications and very rarely surgery is involved. So the average cost of constipation treatment ranges from few hundreds to few thousands. Also, diagnosis of constipation includes blood test and colonoscopy. Cost of these two diagnostic tests varies from hospital to hospital. It is affordable and may range in thousands.\n",

      "Severe forms of this disease can cause dengue shock syndromes and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)\n",
      "The fever has flu-like symptoms that affect infants, young children and adults\n",
      "No specific treatment has been found for dengue fever\n",
      "Fever can be potentially lethal, but early diagnosis and careful management by experienced health care professionals can help to save lives\n",
      "2.5 billion people or 40% of the worldwide population live in risk of dengue transmission\n",
      "70% of the occurrence of this disease, is concentrated in South-East Asia and Western Pacific\n",
      "There has been a recent increase in dengue cases globally. This has been mainly due to factors like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Urbanization\n",
      "Movement of people and goods\n",
      "Favorable climatic conditions\n",
      "Lack of trained staff\n",

      "A. albopictus\n",
      "A. polynesiensis\n",
      "A. scutellaris\n",
      "\n",
      "The mosquitoes usually live in between the latitudes of 35° North and 35° South, below an elevation of 1000 meters\n",
      "Usually, they bite during early morning and in the evening. But they may spread infection, throughout the day\n",
      "\n",
      "Humans are the main hosts of the virus, but it can circulate in primates (like apes and monkeys) too\n",
      "Infection can be caused by a single bite\n",
      "Cycle of Transmission:\n",
      "\n",
      "A female mosquito takes in the blood of a dengue-infected person and becomes a dengue vector (a carrier of disease)\n",
      "In the initial 2 to 10 days, the mosquito itself gets infected with the virus in its gut\n",
      "The virus spreads to all other tissues including the salivary glands, after a period of 8 to 10 days. Ultimately, the saliva is also infected.\n",
      "The mosquito itself, is not adversely affected due to the virus. It continues to be infected for life, which can span from three to four weeks.\n",
      "Aedes aegypti is especially known to spread fever, as it prefers to live in close proximity to human beings. It lays eggs in stored water containers and feed on humans rather than other vertebrates.\n",
      "The infected mosquito then transmits the virus to a person while feeding\n",
      "The saliva of the Aedes aeypti prevents the host's blood from clotting. So the infection transfers from the vector to the host.\n",
      "Four days after being bit by the mosquito, a person develops viremia (a condition where there is a large amount of dengue virus in the blood), which can last for five to twelve days.\n",
      "For the first four days of viremia, no symptoms can be seen. On the fifth day, the person develops signs of dengue fever.\n",
      "If an Aedes aegypti mosquito bites a person during the viremia stage of infection, that mosquito again becomes the carrier of the dengue virus\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Can a person die of dengue fever?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people contracting this fever have no possibility of it turning fatal. But sometimes, complications might develop, like dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In such cases, there is a probability of death. But, under experienced medical supervision, patients suffering from DHF and DSS can recover fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the tests recommended by a doctor to diagnose dengue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dengue fever testing determines whether a person displaying symptoms and recent exposure to dengue, has been infected. It is difficult to diagnose, as some symptoms resemble that of malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two types of tests available are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Antibody tests\n",
      "\n",
      "Mainly used to diagnose current or recent infection\n",
      "Detects various classes of anti-bodies which are produced in response to the infection:\n",
      "\n",
      "IgG\n",
      "IgM\n",
      "\n",
      "A combination of these tests may be required as the immune system produces a wide range of antibodies over the course of the ailment\n",
      "IgM antibodies are the first to be produced. Test for IgM antibodies is most successful when performed at least 7 to 10 days after exposure.\n",
      "Levels of IgM rise for a few weeks, then gradually decrease. A few months later, anti-bodies fall below discernible levels.\n",
      "IgG antibodies are produced more slowly in response to an infection\n",
      "For an acute infection, IgG levels increase, stabilize and persists long-term\n",
      "For people who have already been exposed to the virus earlier, the previous IgG antibodies may affect the results of the diagnostic tests\n",
      "\n",
      "Molecular testing (Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR)\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of test is used to detect dengue virus' genetic material. 5 days after the onset of symptoms, the genetic material can be found in the blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "NS1 (Nonstructural protein 1) antigen test\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a test for dengue which helps in rapid detection of the virus, even on the first day of fever. Antibodies usually appear after 5 days of fever, but diagnosis of dengue can be performed without detecting antibodies in the blood stream.\n",
      "The method of testing is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the cost of dengue tests in India?\n",
      "\n",
      "The rates for performing dengue tests can vary according to several factors. They are, the type of test, the city where the diagnosis is being performed and also, the type of hospital or test centre. To view a comprehensive list of the rates for dengue fever testing, from all over India, click here.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does dengue IgG positive mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "IgM and IgG tests are used to detect dengue antibodies. Positive IgM means that the person undergoing the test has suffered an infection recently. If IgG is positive, and IgM is negligible, then it signifies that the person had been infected by a mosquito in the past.(refer question 10)\n",
      "\n",
      "What is ns1?\n",
      "\n",
      "The NS1 antigen test, where NS1 stands for nonstructural protein 1, is the latest test for dengue which was introduced in 2001. Rapid diagnosis of the fever can be performed on the first day itself, even without the appearance of the antibodies in response to the infection. It was first introduced in India in 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take to recover from dengue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most individuals infected with the disease, have a period of incubation from 10 to 14 days. After that, a week of severe symptoms follow along with a few days of recovery. In total, the fever does not last for more than two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment methods for dengue fever?\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently no medication has been found that can cure dengue. Treatment involves, only relieving the symptoms, as well as letting the infection run its course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paracetamol can be used to relieve pain and fever. Aspirin, ibuprofen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended as internal bleeding can be triggered for people with dengue.\n",
      "Hydration is of prime importance and plenty of fluids should be taken at all times to maintain body fluid volume\n",
      "Plenty of bed rest is required\n",
      "\n",
      "For severe forms of the fever\n",
      "\n",
      "Intravenous fluid supplementation (IV drip): Patients unable to take in fluids orally are required to take IV drips.\n",
      "Blood transfusion: Severe dehydration can be treated with this process.\n",
      "Hospitalization: It is important for medical professionals to monitor vital signs of a patient in case situations take a turn for the worse. Experienced heath care-providers can save lives, if complications arise due to the fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a cure for dengue fever?\n",
      "\n",
      "As dengue is caused by a virus, no specific medication or antibiotics can be used treat it. The only treatment is to treat the symptoms. Relieving the symptoms include taking plenty of rest and adequate hydration.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can dengue fever be prevented?\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary method to prevent transmission of dengue virus is to combat mosquitoes. This can be done by:\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventing mosquitoes to access environments conducive to breeding\n",
      "Proper solid waste disposal and removing man-made habitats\n",

      "Spraying insecticides during outbreaks, for emergency control\n",
      "Wearing loose, full sleeved clothing to avoid skin exposure. Mosquitoes are able to bite through tight fitting clothes, so they should be avoided.\n",
      "Applying insect repellents (N-diethyl-meta-toluamide or DEET); especially around dawn or dusk\n",
      "\n",
      "DEET should not be applied on babies younger than two months\n",

      "\n",
      "Due to being sexually excited, muscles inside penis get relaxed\n",
      "This relaxation leads to increased flow of blood via penile arteries\n",
      "The blood then fills inside the two chambers of penis which are known as Corpora Cavernosa\n",
      "These filled chambers lead to making the penis rigid\n",

      "Hemophilia is a rare group of inherited blood disorders where blood does not clot normally\n",
      "Disorder is mainly due to defects in, \n",
      "  \n",
      "   Blood vessels\n",
      "   Coagulation mechanism\n",
      "   Blood platelets\n",
      "   \n",
      "A person afflicted with this condition can bleed spontaneously or longer, than a healthy person after injury or surgery\n",
      "Internal bleeding can also occur, that can damage organs and tissues. This condition can be life-threatening\n",
      "The blood coagulation mechanism changes blood from liquid to a solid, involving several clotting factors\n",
      "Fibrin is generated by the body and activated. Together with a platelet plug, it helps to stop bleeding.\n",
      "Coagulation factors are missing or deficient when blood does not clot properly\n",
      "Hemophilia A or B patients have genetic defects which give rise to deficiency in one of the blood clotting factors\n",
      "Hemophilia is rarely an “acquired” disorder\n",
      "   \n",
      "   “Acquired” means that the disorder was developed during a person's lifetime\n",
      "   Mainly it happens when the body forms antibodies that attack the clotting factors in the bloodstream\n",
      "   The antibodies may prevent the clotting factor from working\n",
      "   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the types of Hemophilia?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two most common types of hemophilia are hemophilia A and hemophilia B\n",
      "Hemophilia A accounts for a majority of cases\n",
      "Hemophilia A is caused by insufficient clotting factor VIII\n",
      "Hemophilia B is the result of deficiency in clotting factor IX\n",
      "Symptoms are similar for both cases, but they have different clotting factors and slightly different treatments\n",
      "A third and unusual type of hemophilia also exists, known as Hemophilia C. It is caused by insufficient clotting factor XI. \n",
      "A rare form of hemophilia, also known as acquired hemophilia, is another type of this disorder. It is caused by the immune system, attacking clotting factors of blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are the people affected by this disorder?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most hemophilia patients are males, due to the way this condition is inherited\n",
      "It is estimated that one boy in 5000 will be born with hemophilia A. Whereas, one boy in every 30,000 will be born with hemophilia B.\n",
      "Women with the hemophilia gene can experience problems due to bleeding, such as, heavy periods\n",
      "A girl can be born with hemophilia when both parents have the hemophilia gene\n",
      "Tests can be performed before, during and after pregnancy, to find out whether the child has this disorder\n",
      "If there is no family history for hemophilia, it can be diagnosed when symptoms appear during childhood\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes of hemophilia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemophilia is a genetic disorder caused due to mutation within the genes for coagulation factors VIII or IX\n",
      "In 70% of cases, hemophilia is inherited from a parent. Whereas for the rest of the cases, family history may be absent or may not be apparent.\n",
      "In cases where the disorder is acquired, the condition may be caused by a spontaneous genetic mutation at the time of fertilization\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The gene causing hemophilia usually contains information for the body to make clotting factors\n",
      "  The gene is present in the X chromosome which is referred to as the sex chromosome\n",
      "  A person's gender is determined by the pairing of two sex chromosomes (X and Y) inherited from their parents\n",
      "  Males have XY pairing while females have XX pairing. One chromosome is supplied by the father and one from the mother. Fathers can provide either X or Y of the pair, whereas mothers give only X chromosomes.\n",
      "  Men with hemophilia can transmit the Y Chromosome to their sons and the altered X chromosome to their daughters\n",
      "    \n",
      "\tSons are not affected by the altered gene, whereas daughters become carriers because they carry the modified gene (also known as obligate carriers)\n",
      "\tWomen carriers have one altered gene from their father and one properly functioning gene from their mother\n",
      "    If a male child inherits his mother's unaltered gene, he will not have hemophilia\n",
      "\tThe male child will have hemophilia, in case he inherits his mother's affected X chromosome\n",
      "\tIf a female child inherits her mother's modified gene then she will be a carrier. There is a 50% chance that a female carrier's son (XY) will have hemophilia\n",
      "\t\n",
      "   \n",
      "Female carriers of Hemophilia:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  A female carrier can pass on the gene for hemophilia to her children, if she is a carrier. Normally, such a person does not experience any symptoms.\n",
      "  A woman is an obligate carrier of hemophilia, when one of the following conditions apply:\n",
      "    \n",
      "\tShe is the biological daughter of a man who has hemophilia\n",
      "\tShe is the biological mother of more than one son with hemophilia\n",

      "\t\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Though this condition is commonly found in males because it is an X chromosome linked disorder, sometimes it can cause bleeding symptoms in females too. Some significant cases are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptomatic carriers: Female carriers can have low (below 50%) levels of either FVIII or FIX and experience bleeding symptoms. Female carriers who exhibit bleeding symptoms are called symptomatic carriers.\n",
      "Daughters of a man with hemophilia and a mother who is a carrier: The daughter then inherits an altered X chromosome from each parent and so, will have hemophilia.\n",
      "Turner's syndrome: A rare chromosomal condition, in which females possess only one set of X chromosome. If these girls inherit the affected gene, they will suffer from this disease.\n",

      "Can girls have hemophilia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemophilia is more common in males. However, girls can develop hemophilia if she inherits the altered gene from her father, as well as her mother. Thus, it is possible, but only in rare cases (refer question 4)\n",

      "What are the symptoms of hemophilia?\n",
      "The crucial signs and symptoms of hemophilia include excessive bleeding and easy bruising.\n",
      "Excessive Bleeding\n",
      "\n",
      "The extent of bleeding depends on severity of hemophilia\n",
      "Children who have mild hemophilia may not have apparent signs of this disorder. However, during a dental procedure or an accident, there may be excessive bleeding.\n",
      "\tCircumcision in males may also lead to heavy bleeding.\n",
      "Bleeding can be internal, as well as external\n",
      "Signs of external bleeding are:\n",

      "  Large bruises (bleeding into large muscles of the body)\n",
      "  \n",
      "Bleeding in the Joints\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Bleeding in knees, elbows and joints is a usual form of hemophilia. This can occur without any obvious injury.\n",
      "  Internal bleeding in joints is not visible, nor does it cause any acute pain. There may be tightness in joints which can become swollen, painful to bend and hot to touch\n",
      "  As bleeding continues, so does the swelling. Finally, movement in the joint is lost temporarily. There may be acute pain and if it is not treated immediately, it can cause further damage to the joint.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Bleeding in the Brain\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The most severe effect due to hemophilia is internal bleeding in the brain\n",
      "  Even a minor bump to the head or a serious injury, can lead to internal bleeding\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the main cause of hemophilia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly hemophilia emerges as a genetic disorder, which means that the genetic makeup of a person determines whether the person has hemophilia or not. The condition is mainly caused by a defect in the clotting factor gene that lies on the X chromosome.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If there's no family history of hemophilia, it is possible to diagnose only when the child begins to walk or crawl. Bleeding in joints and easy bruising of the child may be a sign of this disorder.\n",
      "Mild hemophilia may be found later on, usually after injury or a dental or surgical procedure\n",
      "Tests before pregnancy:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Genetic testing is available to determine the probability of passing the condition, to a child\n",
      "  This involves testing a sample of a patient's tissues or blood to look for signs of genetic mutation that can give rise to hemophilia\n",
      "  \n",
      "Tests during pregnancy:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  If a person has a family history of hemophilia and is pregnant, then tests for the altered gene need to be performed. These include:\n",
      "    \n",
      "\tChorionic villus sampling (CVS)- A small sample of placenta is taken from the womb and tested for the modified gene, normally during 11th to 14th week of pregnancy.\n",
      "\tAmniocentesis- A sample of amniotic fluid is extracted for testing, usually during 15th to 20th week of pregnancy\n",
      "\t\n",
      "  There remains a slight risk of miscarriages or premature labor due to these procedures. Therefore, a person must fully discuss the risks involved with a doctor, before carrying out these tests.\n",
      "   \n",
      "Tests after birth:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  If hemophilia is suspected after the child is born, a blood test will be able to confirm the diagnosis\n",
      "  Blood from the umbilical cord, can be tested if there is a family history of hemophilia\n",
      "  A blood test can be used to verify if the child has hemophilia A or B and how severe it is\n",

      "\n",
      "Complete Blood Count (CBC):\n",
      "  \n",
      "  CBC is used to find the following factors:\n",

      "\tPlatelets\n",
      "\t\n",
      "  A person with hemophilia has normal CBC. However in cases when a person suffers excessive bleeding for a long time, the count for red blood cell or hemoglobin is low.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) Test:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  APTT test is used to calculate, how long it takes for blood to clot\n",
      "  Factors VIII, IX, XI and XII can be measured with this test\n",
      "  If clotting factors are very low, it takes longer than usual for blood to clot\n",
      "  The results of this test show a longer clotting time for people with hemophilia A and B\n",
      "  \n",
      "Fibrinogen Test\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Doctors use this test to assess the ability of a patient to form blood clots\n",
      "  Fibrinogen test is ordered if a patient has an abnormal APTT or PT test result\n",
      "  Fibrinogen is also known as clotting factor I\n",
      "  \n",
      "Clotting factor tests, also called as factor assays are used to diagnose hemophilia\n",

      "\n",
      "How does a woman become a carrier of hemophilia?\n",
      "A father can give half of his sex chromosomes to a child. So either it is X or it is Y chromosome. If the child inherits the Y chromosome it will be a boy and if X it will be a girl. If the boy inherits an altered X chromosome from the mother then he will hemophilia. Thus the mother is a carrier of the disorder as she herself does not suffer from the condition, but can pass on the hemophilia gene to her children.\n",

      "Replacement Therapy\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The primary treatment for hemophilia is replacement therapy\n",
      "  Concentrates of clotting factors VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are injected or slowly dripped into a vein. This helps to replace low levels of clotting factors.\n",
      "  Clotting factor concentrates are usually made from human blood\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The blood is first treated to prevent the spread of diseases like hepatitis\n",
      "    Chances of getting an infectious disease from clotting factors are very low, due to current methods of screening and treating donated blood\n",
      "    Some clotting factors are not created from human blood. This further reduces the risk of spreading infectious diseases. Such kinds of clotting factors are known as recombinant clotting factors.\n",

      "   Inhibitors are usually generated during the first year of treatment, but it can happen any time\n",
      "   Hemophilia B patients rarely develop inhibitors, but if it does, then the person can experience life-threatening anaphylaxis during treatment\n",
      "   People with mild to moderate hemophilia A generally require a test after receiving intensive treatment, or annually with normal treatment\n",
      "   Inhibitors are temporary problems, but if it is constant, then there are ways of managing it\n",

      "Poor diet\n",
      "Smoking\n",
      "Low physical activity\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination of the above factors can lead to a condition called atherosclerosis that thickens and narrows arteries. The difficulty in such a condition is that symptoms are not visible for years. The thickening or narrowing of arteries happens via deposition of cholesterol and some other substances inside blood vessel walls. These deposits called plaques, rupture and lead to heart attack or stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different types of heart diseases?\n",
      "Heart diseases comprise of various conditions that affect irregular functioning of your heart. The most common type is coronary heart disease that may be caused due to atherosclerosis (Refer question 1). Other important heart ailments include:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Do the general signs and symptoms of heart diseases differ for males and females?\n",
      "Symptoms and signs of heart disease such as attack in males are intense pain in chest, left arm, jaw and hindrance in correct breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Females may witness similar symptoms as males, however, pain is more diffused and might spread to neck, abdomen, back, arms and shoulders. Additionally, indigestion is also experienced. Anxiety, cold sweat, palpitations, dizziness and nausea are also visible signs in women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important differentiator is that females have severe attacks that mostly result in death in comparison to males.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the preventive measures you can adopt for reducing risk of heart diseases?\n",
      "Certain changes in lifestyle can be effective to keep heart diseases at bay. These changes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Quit smoking: This is the crucial step to take as risk of coronary heart ailments, strokes and attacks increases due to smoking.\n",
      "Correct diet and nutrition: Maintaining a diet that includes omega-3 fatty acids, vegetables, fruits and whole grains and limiting intake of red meat is necessary. Keeping a tab of foods that can increase calories and opting for nutritional foods is important.\n",
      "Weight management and exercise: Maintaining correct levels of weight along with regular exercise is important to keep your blood pressure in control; thus preventing heart diseases.\n",
      "Diabetes control: Keeping diabetes in control is important to avoid risks of heart diseases.\n",
      "Manage stress: Studies have proved that stress prevailing for long duration can lead to heart disease. So engaging in habits that reduce stress is vital to prevent heart ailments.\n",

      "What is the meaning of cardiac rehab?\n",
      "Cardiac rehabilitation is a term that corresponds to structured programs for smoking cessation, graded exercise and dietary advice useful for patients who suffer for heart attacks and for diagnosis of some cardiac conditions or angina. Such rehab centers have trained staff for supervising exercise and other programs for patients. Once the prescribed program at the cardiac rehab is completed, patients can perform these exercise and other regimes at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any relation between heart disease and AIDS?\n",
      "The link between heart disease and AIDS can be found in couple of ways as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "AIDS virus may infect your heart causing cardiomyopathy which leads to weakening of heart muscles; thus resulting in muscles not contracting properly and patient finding symptoms of breath shortness.\n",
      "Some medications prescribed for treatment of AIDS may increase triglyceride levels in blood and also decrease HDL. Reports suggest that there have been cases wherein patients treated with AIDS medicines dying due to premature heart attacks.\n",

      "Hepatitis C(HCV) is a blood-borne virus\n",
      "The virus affects the liver and leads to its inflammation\n",
      "Hepatitis means inflammation. Normally it refers to the swelling of the liver. If it is inflamed in any way, the liver has a harder time performing its function.\n",
      "Besides the liver, it can also affect other parts of the body. For example, the stomach, the brain or the immune system.\n",
      "Hepatitis C can be of six types. They are differentiated according to their genotype. It is numbered from 1 to 6 (eg. Genotype 1, Genotype 2... and so on).\n",
      "It is essential to know the strain of the virus which the patient has been infected by. Different types of viruses responds to medication, differently. It is possible for a person to be infected by more than one virus at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the function of the liver and how is it related to Hepatitis C?\n",
      "To understand how the Hep C infection occurs, a basic understanding of the liver's function is required. This is because, the liver is mainly affected during the infection. The primary functions of the liver are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Converting Sugar to Glycogen. Glycogen is used as a fuel for the body. When energy is required, it is broken down again and released into the blood.\n",
      "Synthesizing proteins essential to the blood clotting mechanism\n",
      "Process fats and proteins from digested food\n",
      "Acts like a filter to remove harmful chemicals, like alcohol, drugs, poisons and toxins\n",
      "Secretes a yellowish-green enzyme called as bile, which assists in the breakdown of fats. The bile passes from the liver, down the bile duct, to the stomach. This assists in the absorption of fats in the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How is the virus transmitted?\n",
      "Hepatitis C is commonly transmitted by exposure to the blood or bodily fluids that have already been affected. This can happen:\n",
      "\n",
      "By sharing needles, injection and equipment while using drugs\n",
      "By birth, a mother can transfer the virus to her child\n",
      "In hospitals, where adequate sterilization processes are not being followed (before 1992)\n",
      "Organ Transplants (before 1992)\n",
      "Getting tattoos and piercings at unlicensed tattoo parlors\n",
      "Household contact (sharing razors, toothbrushes)\n",
      "Sexual contact. This, however, is not a very common.\n",

      "\n",
      "Acute Phase\n",
      "\n",
      "First six months is called as acute phase\n",
      "No symptoms at first. If at all present, very mild ones.\n",
      "Seven to eight weeks later, the first symptoms start to emerge\n",
      "Feeling of illness, nausea and vomiting\n",
      "Some people might get jaundice at this time. The symptoms of jaundice, like yellowness of the eyes, skin etc. can be observed.\n",
      "This occurs due to an excess of the enzyme bilirubin which spreads across the blood stream\n",
      "For 1 in 5 cases, the immune system clears the infection within two to six months. Younger people are more prone to fight the virus and then show no long term effects.\n",
      "Rest of the cases (4 out of 5) go on to develop a chronic infection and suffer from life long effects\n",
      "\n",
      "Chronic Phase\n",
      "\n",
      "After six months, the infection enters into the chronic phase\n",
      "Even at this stage people might not develop any noticeable symptoms. But when they pass the virus to other people, the infected people may develop problems further on.\n",
      "The virus causes different reaction in different people and this makes the treatment more difficult\n",
      "The symptoms of Hepatitis C develop for some people. Like intolerance to alcohol, liver pains and depression.\n",
      "Extreme fatigue, memory loss, poor concentration, joint aches and pains are also common.\n",
      "The severity of the symptoms does not indicate heavy liver damage. People with no outward indication of the disease might suffer from inflammation.\n",
      "One-third of those infected might develop liver cirrhosis, over a duration of 20 to 30 years. Cirrhosis means scarring of the liver and causes severe damage. Finally liver failure can occur and even cancer.\n",

      "\n",
      "Serological Test which identifies people who have been infected by the virus by screening for antibodies of HCV\n",
      "A Nucleic acid test for people who have tested positive for the previous test. This is only for confirmation, as sometimes people who have tested positive for antibodies, might fight the infection and clear it. Thus, they test negative for the nucleic acid test.\n",
      "Biopsy of the liver for evaluation of damage (Cirrhosis or fibroids). Many non-invasive tests can also be performed. \n",

      "The expenses for performing Hepatitis tests might differ between cities, type of hospitals and diagnostic centers chosen. To get an extensive list, with the charges offered in your city, click here.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different treatment methods for Hepatitis C?\n",
      "Hepatitis C sometimes does not require treatment as the immune response is enough to clear the infection. Some people who suffer from chronic infection might not develop liver damage. The cure rate depends on the strain of the virus and the treatment being prescribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weekly injections of interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks cured half of the people tested with this drug. Frequently, the other half of the people tested did not respond well to this treatment. \n",
      "Recently, a new antiviral drug has been introduced in the market. This drug is called as Direct Antiviral Agents.\n",
      "The treatment is safer and shorter \n",
      "Though the production costs of this is quite low, the initial cost is quite high. This makes the drugs very expensive.\n",
      "Finally, if the liver has been damaged severely, then a liver transplant may be required\n",
      "Liver transplant may not be a permanent cure for HCV. The virus might recur and fibroids and cirrhosis might occur again.\n",
      "People might choose to opt for the alternative therapy route by keeping the liver and immunity system healthy. Ayurvedic medicine, milk thistle, massage, acupuncture therapy are methods that are sometimes used to good results. As Hepatitis C cannot be completely cured, a balance of the two methods of treatment might be used for optimum health.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are preventive measures to adopt for avoiding Hepatitis C?\n",
      "\n",
      "Needles should not be shared. Prevention of drug abuse can reduce the risk of infection.\n",
      "Health care workers should take care to avoid exposure to infected blood. A strict sterilization process should be followed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Personal items like toothbrushes and razors should never be shared among members of a household.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Jaundice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaundice is a medical condition leading to yellowish discoloration of skin and eyes. Jaundice is not a disease, but a symptom of many underlying diseases. The word Jaundice has a French origin and is derived from the word “Jaunisse” meaning yellowness. The yellowish discoloration is brought about by excess Bilirubin in body. Jaundice is also known as icterus.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Bilirubin?\n",
      "Bilirubin is a substance that is naturally formed in the liver when old red blood cells are broken down. It is a waste product and the liver functions to eliminate this waste from the body. Bilirubin is yellow in color and it is this that gives stool its usual color. Bilirubin is present in two important forms in body:\n",
      "\n",
      "Indirect or Unconjugated Bilirubin: Bilirubin in this form flows freely in blood. It is insoluble and flows through the bloodstream and reaches the liver. When in liver, the bilirubin is changed into soluble form.\n",
      "Direct or Conjugated Bilirubin: Bilirubin in this form is formed by the liver and is totally soluble in water. Direct bilirubin is derived from indirect bilirubin. Direct bilirubin is latched with other chemicals in liver and is secreted in bile that excretes it from body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liver functions to remove Bilirubin from the body, along with waste materials. However, when the body fails to remove this excess Bilirubin (a condition known as hyperbilirubinemia), it spreads to other nearby tissues and thus gives the yellowish tinge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is liver dysfunction the only cause of jaundice?\n",
      "As excretion of Bilirubin is carried out by liver, a malfunctioning liver has to be one of the primary reasons behind excess bilirubin in body; leading to yellowness of skin or what is known as Jaundice. However, besides this, there are number of other factors that may result in wrong retention of bilirubin in blood, leading to jaundice.\n",
      "Following are some of the causes of Jaundice:\n",
      "\n",
      "Liver inflammation: As already mentioned, impaired liver cannot conjugate bilirubin and thus cannot excrete it from body, causing jaundice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bile duct obstruction or inflammation: Bile is a digestive juice secreted by liver and functions to remove bilirubin from body. It is produced by liver and stored in gallbladder. Bile from gallbladder is carried to the small intestine by bile duct. Any obstruction of this duct hampers bile juice release in small intestine and thus excess bilirubin is retained in body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hemolytic anemia: Hemolytic anemia is a medical condition where red blood cells die at a faster rate as compared to their production in bone marrow. The abrupt increase in the number of dead red blood cells produces excess bilirubin; so much that the liver faces a tough time excreting bilirubin from the body. Thus, body has excess bilirubin content causing jaundice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pseudojaundice: A comparatively harmless condition where yellowish discoloration is not due to bilirubin, but beta carotene obtained from excess consumption of carrots and melons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilbert's Syndrome: A genetic condition where a person is born with malfunctioning enzymes that do not process bile excretion in a normal metabolic manner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Crigler Najjar Syndrome: A condition where enzyme specific to bilirubin processing is impaired and thus, billirubin does not excrete from body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dubin Johnson Syndrome: An inherited condition where conjugated bilirubin does not excrete from liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean by infant jaundice?\n",
      "Infant jaundice is a very common scenario affecting most babies born prior to completion of pregnancy span. Babies born before 38 weeks, completion and those that are breast feeding, show jaundice symptoms very commonly. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is not something to be worried about as it does not suggest that your baby is born with a weak liver. Every new born baby has a small liver that is not yet functional to remove bilirubin being produced. As the baby grows, the organs become stronger and function normally. \n",
      "\n",
      "Infant jaundice often subsides normally without any medication as such. However, sometimes medication can also be prescribed by your pediatrician. Rarest cases of complications may arise where excess bilirubin in a baby may lead to brain damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes infant jaundice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following are some of the possible reasons leading to jaundice:\n",
      "\n",
      "An underdeveloped liver. Very common and mostly not a reason to worry about. \n",
      "Some form of internal bleeding \n",
      "Blood infection of the infant \n",
      "Enzyme malfunction or deficiency \n",
      "Abnormal red blood cells that break down more than usual \n",
      "Mother's blood is not compatible with her baby. This causes the baby to receive antibodies from mother that trigger break down of RBCs.  \n",
      "Any other bacterial or viral infection \n",
      "A baby who is not being sufficiently breastfed may develop jaundice\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not showing yellowish tinge. Can I still have Jaundice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yellowish discoloration is a vivid symptom of jaundice. However, many a times some people may show delayed discoloration; even when suffering from jaundice. Therefore, knowing other related symptoms of Jaundice is equally essential.\n",
      "Following are common symptoms of Jaundice:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yellowish tinge of skin and eyes \n",
      "Severe abdominal pain \n",
      "Discolored urine and stool. Urine appears darker than usual and stool seems lighter than regular \n",
      "High fever and vomiting \n",
      "Unexplained weight loss \n",
      "Feeling of extreme weakness and fatigue \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different types of Jaundice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the factors leading to excess bilirubin in body, Jaundice has been categorized into following types:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hepatocellular Jaundice: This type of Jaundice is caused due to malfunctioning liver. \n",
      "Hemolytic Jaundice: Jaundice that arises due to excess break down of red blood cells \n",
      "Obstructive Jaundice: Jaundice that arises due to obstructed bile duct \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the laboratory tests available for Jaundice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Following are the common diagnostic tests to determine Jaundice:\n",
      "\n",
      "Liver Function Test – To determine how well your liver is functioning. If this test is sufficient to confirm jaundice, no other tests are needed. However, if the doctor feels the need of some other blood tests, you may be ordered for the following tests. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilirubin Test – To determine the exact amount of bilirubin in your blood. Ratios of indirect and direct bilirubin are tested to find what type of jaundice are you suffering from. \n",
      "\n",
      "CBC Test – To determine count of RBCs to confirm if you are suffering from Hemolytic Jaundice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hepatitis A, B and C tests are also prescribed \n",
      "Imaging tests are ordered to detect obstructions of any form\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I have all these tests done?\n",
      "\n",
      "All the above mentioned tests are available with different diagnostic centers at affordable prices. Get the list of nearest diagnostic center in your city here, according to your requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is treating jaundice very difficult?\n",
      "No. Jaundice treatments are easily administered depending on the causative reason behind. Following are the treatment options for jaundice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemolytic Jaundice is treated with iron medication. Including iron rich food in diet is also effective.\n",
      "Steroid medications also prove effective in treating jaundice. \n",
      "Bile obstructions can only be treated with surgical remedies. However, this is comparatively rarer to happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can jaundice prove fatal in adults?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaundice is not usually fatal. However, adults who suffer from severe liver troubles develop chronic jaundice and may prove life threatening. Elderly people suffering from jaundice need to be given extra attention. Hospitalization is usually suggested. \n",
      "\n",
      "People in the habit of excessive alcohol consumption, damage their liver to an extent where it becomes irreversible and sooner or later develop fatal jaundice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Green stool in infants under jaundice treatment. Is something serious?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. This is something very common and has no reasons to worry. Infant jaundice usually does not need medication and it disappears within a week or two. However, if your baby has been ordered a jaundice treatment, green stool is a common scenario to witness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors use phototherapy to treat jaundice in infants. Your baby is put under a light source and the skin and blood absorbs light waves. This light helps the infant's body to change bilirubin into waste that can get eliminated easily. \n",
      "\n",
      "Post treatment, frequent bowel movements with greenish stool indicates that the body is capable of eliminating the excess bilirubin and thus treating jaundice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the ideal diet for jaundice patients?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mentioned here is a suggested diet for jaundice patients. However, always know that your doctor would be the best person to guide you during your treatment phase. Discuss with your doctor before making any substantial change in your diet:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluids such as water and juice should be a core part of your diet. For the first few days, this is what you will need to have. \n",
      "Fruits filled with fresh juice \n",
      "Green vegetables such as spinach\n",
      "Vegetable soup is also good for your health and equally filling \n",
      "Lemon juice with warm water proves an effective home remedy \n",
      "Whole wheat \n",
      "No fats, fried or spicy food need to be taken\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take to recover from jaundice?\n",
      "\n",
      "It usually takes around 1 – 2 months to completely recover from jaundice. However, with the end of 3rd week or so, you can get back to your normal work life as the associated weakness, pain and itching will disappear now. However, stick to the diet you are already following, as the liver is still not in its best forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How can you prevent jaundice?\n",
      "Adopting the below mentioned steps can help prevent jaundice to a large extent:\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted alcohol consumption: Alcohol greatly damages your liver and an affected liver definitely leads to jaundice. Therefore, restricting alcohol consumption is mandatory to prevent adult jaundice. \n",
      "Controlling body weight: Obesity can be detrimental to your health and may certainly impair your liver function. \n",
      "Wholesome diet: A diet rich in essential nutrients, maintains an overall healthy physical and mental state. Normal and healthy enzyme functions are assured with a healthy diet. \n",
      "Exercising: Regular exercises also add to your overall health status.\n",

      "\n",
      "What are functions of kidney?\n",
      "Kidneys are organs responsible for waste management and elimination of toxins from the body. Their prime functions are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste removal-The kidneys remove toxins, urea and excess salts from the body by way of excreta.\n",
      "Healthy balance of acids-Kidneys maintain healthy balance of acids in the body.\n",
      "Hydration-Kidneys also play a key role in maintaining water levels in the body even when water intake is less.\n",
      "Produce hormones-Kidneys produce hormones which help in regulating blood pressure, bone health and increase red blood cell count.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are kidney stones?\n",
      "Nephrolithiasis or kidney stones are different sized crystal stones \tforming in kidney and urinary tract.\n",
      "What leads to formation of kidney stones?\n",
      "Different causes contribute to formation of kidney stones in people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Urinary infection- Kidney stones are formed when water, minerals and salts present in urine go out of proportion.\n",
      "Calcium levels- High levels of calcium in urine cause kidney stones. Moreover, discharge of calcium from kidney into urine is also responsible for causing kidney stones.\n",
      "Inadequate water consumption- When people do not consume adequate water, stones are formed out of elements in urine like salt, water and minerals.\n",
      "Hyperparathyroidism- When parathyroid glands in neck secrete excess parathyroid hormone, it causes serious calcium imbalance and kidney stones. If left untreated, hyperparathyroidism can give rise to osteoporosis, kidney failure, high blood pressure etc.\n",
      "Hypercalciuria- This is a disorder wherein calcium from food is absorbed more than what is required. Further, it gets into the urine leading to formation of stones of calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate in kidney or urinary tract.\n",
      "Genetics- A family history of kidney stones is likely to increase chances of newer generations also getting it\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the types of kidney stones?\n",
      "Kidney stones are classified according to different chemical combinations. Few types of kidney stones occurring in people are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cystine stones- Cystine stones or Cystinuria is a genetic condition. It is an uncommon condition occurring when amino acidic stones form in ureter, bladder and kidney.These stones are made of cysteine and build up in urine in stone form instead of getting dissolved. This type is a very rare form of kidney stone.\n",
      "Calcium stones- Calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate are 2 types of calcium stones. Calcium oxalate stones are formed because of high calcium levels, whereas calcium phosphate are a result of heightened acidic levels in urine.\n",
      "Uric acid stones- High levels of acid in urine, which fails to dissolve, gets converted to stones. These type of stones occur when the person doesn't include sufficient amounts of fluids in his daily routine. People consuming high amounts of animal protein tend to have increased levels of uric acid in their urine. Also, this type is the most common kidney stone condition.\n",
      "Struvite stones- Struvite stones form out of kidney and urinary tract infections. Women are likelier to suffer from struvite stones more than men. These are also termed as triple phosphate stones which disturb chemical balance of urine.\n",
      "\n",
      "How are kidney stones diagnosed?\n",
      "Kidney stones are diagnosed by the doctor through imaging, blood and urine tests. They become easier to diagnose if you have had a family history of stone disorder. The doctor may also be able to detect it through your diet and lifestyle habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imaging Tests- Imaging tests such as X-rays, ultrasound, CT Scans enable the doctor to examine the internal organs and detect abnormalities and kidney stones developed in urinary tract and kidney. The exact size and location of the stone are correctly detected through these imaging tests.\n",
      "Kidney Stone Analysis- The patient is asked to pass a stone through urine and collect it using a kidney stone strainer. It then has to be provided to a laboratory for further chemical testing.\n",
      "Urinalysis- A sample of 30-60 ml of urine is collected and tested for presence of bacteria and harmful micro-organisms. Not only kidney stones, but any irregularities or impairment can be detected through urinalysis.\n",
      "Blood chemistry screen- It is also called blood fasting test. It is done to ascertain levels of calcium, electrolytes and other substances responsible for causing kidney stones.\n",
      "Kidney Ultrasound- An ultrasound machine uses sound waves for creating images on the screen, which reveal stones, cysts or other irregularities in kidney.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of kidney stones?\n",
      "Kidney stones are usually asymptomatic. They may not indicate their \texistence until they cause movements in your ureter or kidney. However, here are few of the symptoms experienced by people suffering from kidney stones:\n",
      "\n",
      "Nausea- A general nauseatic feeling or painful bouts of vomiting are characteristic of kidney stones.\n",
      "Aches- Aching back and lower abdomen.\n",
      "Frequent urinating- The person feels a constant need of urinating at frequent intervals.\n",
      "Urinary infections- Difficulty in passing urine or seeing blood pass through urine is cause of worry and indicates kidney stone.\n",
      "Fever- Fever with chills with any of the above signs also could indicate kidney stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the ideal diet for people suffering from kidney stones?\n",
      "\n",
      "Limit your sodium intake- This means reducing intake of sodium rich foods like chips, processed foods, restaurant foodstuffs and canned items. Your diet should be such that you should maintain 2000 mg sodium in your everyday diet.\n",
      "Fluids and juices- Fruit juices prepared at home, lemonades, soups are beneficial because they prevent stones from enlarging. The processed juices may only increase chances of kidney stones from aggravating; all thanks to the sugar content.\n",
      "Dietary Calcium- Do not reduce your intake of dietary calcium as that could mean worsening the kidney stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take for a person to recover from kidney stones?\n",
      "Lithotripsy is the medical procedure for extracting kidney stones. Overall, the entire procedure lasts for about 45 minutes to an hour. There are chances that the patient may need more than one session to treat the kidney stones completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take for a person to recover from kidney stones?\n",
      "Kidney stones when small in size are treatable at home. They can be \tpassed out through urine. When they become too large and untreatable through medications, surgery is the only option left for treating patients of stones. Following surgeries are utilized by urologists for treatment of kidney stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)- Stones that exceed 2cm and cannot be treated using ureteroscopy require this surgical procedure. It is also referred to as nephrolithotripsy. It is a minimally invasive surgery lasting for about 20-45 minutes. A nephroscope is used for accessing the kidney through incision. The stones are fragmented and then extracted from there.\n",
      "Ureteroscopy- Ureteroscopy is also referred to as Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS). It is done when stones are stuck in urethral lining. A ureteroscope is used to push the stones into the kidney and then extracted with the help of lithotriptic procedure.\n",
      "Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy- High energy shock waves generated from a lithotripter are directed towards the stones for crushing them. A tube is inserted into the bladder for facilitating passage of stones through urine.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the age group that is affected by kidney stones?\n",
      "Urologists feel that the stressful times today have led to kidney stones being common among young people in their 20s and 30s.\n",
      "How can kidney stones be prevented?\n",
      "Kidney stones can be prevented from recurring by following few dietary restrictions and changes. Few of them are as listed below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinking adequate water- Patients suffering from kidney stones should consume 2.5-3 liters of fluids and equal amount of water to keep the stones from redeveloping.\n",
      "Coconut water- Coconut water promotes eliminating kidney stones by way of urine and also keeps the body from dehydration. And so its consumption will facilitate flushing out stones in an early phase.\n",
      "Juices- Juices of fruits like orange, cranberry, apple and even lime water should be consumed as these fluids prevent stone formation.\n",
      "A low-oxalate diet- Avoid foods like cashews, soy products, spinach, tea, chocolate which contain oxalate in high amounts.\n",
      "Dairy products- Dairy products like milk, cheese, butter, ghee etc. contain high amounts of calcium, which is dangerous for people suffering from or who have suffered from kidney stones.\n",
      "Seafood- Seafoods high on purine such as herrings, sardines, tuna should be avoided. Uric stones are formed due to excess consumption of such seafood and protein rich foods.\n",
      "Controlled protein intake- Foods which contain animal protein such as meat, poultry, eggs, fish etc. increase acid content in urine reducing possibility of stone formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there any fruits and vegetables that can cause kidney stones and need to be avoided?\n",
      "Spinach is a green vegetable high on oxalate content. The oxalate in spinach combines with calcium in your urine and is capable to form calcium oxalate stone, which is a type of kidney stone. Tomatoes are another oxalate rich ingredients used in everyday cooked food or dal. Its use should be restricted. Guava, beetroot and sweet potatoes are few fruits high on oxalate and so need to be avoided.\n",
      "Can beer help one in getting rid of kidney stones?\n",
      "No. It is a myth that beer consumption can make you get rid of kidney stones. On the contrary, beer promotes formation of kidney stones by increasing your calcium levels in urine. Drinking beer over long periods of time can not only give you kidney stones, but also heartburn.\n",
      "Which body parts experience pain in event of a kidney stone?\n",
      "Urologists and medical experts emphasize that kidney stone is an extremely painful disease; only second to child birth. The person feels severe pain in parts like flank, testis, loins and of course kidney in frequent bouts.\n",
      "How to dissolve kidney stones naturally?\n",
      "Kidney is a key organ in the human body to keep it free from toxins. The kidneys dysfunction when kidney disorders like kidney stones strike. \tHere are few natural remedies for reducing discomfort with organic means:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pomegranate Juice- Pomegranate seeds and juice contain astringent properties and so are extremely good for people suffering from kidney stones.\n",
      "Basil Tea- Kidney stone effects can be alleviated by consuming basil juice and honey for six months. Basil tea is also a very good option for the same.\n",
      "Lemon juice and olive oil concoction- A combination of olive oil and lemon juice in equal quantities consumed twice a day is said to eliminate stones easily in few days.\n",
      "Watermelon- The high water content in watermelon is beneficial and helps in keeping people hydrated. It also facilitates passing urine and thus, proper excretion of toxins from the body happens smoothly.\n",
      "Vitamin B6 rich foods- Vitamin B6 is a vitamin necessary for the body to maintain proper metabolism. Pistachio nuts, tuna fish, dry fruits, avocados and bananas are few sources of foods rich in vitamin B.\n",
      "Grapes- Grapes are diuretics and have potassium salts and are extremely instrumental in eliminating kidney disorders and stones.\n",
      "Magnesium supplements- Magnesium supplements are known to reduce recurrence of kidney stones. Ideally, 300mgs of magnesium taken daily can reduce occurrence of kidney stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the cost of kidney stone treatment in India?\n",
      "Costs of treatments required for kidney stones in India will depend on the severity of your ailment. Additionally, the city of your residence, diagnostic centers, hospital and equipment's used by these health care entities will form the base for cost involved. You can get more information about kidney stone treatment cost in India here.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria can be fatal disease wherein patient experiences severe headache, fever and low immunity power. Bite of infected female anopheles mosquito causes malaria. An infected mosquito carries plasmodium parasite.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are total 5 types of plasmodium parasites- Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, plasmodium malariae, plasmodium ovale and plasmodium knowlesi. These parasites are released into the bloodstream when infected mosquito bites. Parasites mature in liver and after several days enter into bloodstream where they start affecting red blood cells. Within 2-3 days, parasites begin to multiply and harm whole body.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria is basically caused by bite of plasmodium parasite infected female anopheles mosquito. When another mosquito bites infected person, it becomes infected with parasite for lifetime and can spread malaria through its bite. It can also be passed down by infected mother to her baby. The primary mode of transmission of malaria is through blood. Hence, it can be transmitted by organ implant, blood transfusion and infected syringes and other medical tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does plasmodium cause malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Plasmodium is a type of parasite. Parasites are organisms that live inside the body of host (another organism) and derive nutrients from the host's body. Infected female anopheles mosquito acts as a malaria vector. There are total five species of parasites responsible for malaria in human beings out of which two species- P. falciparum and P. vivax pose maximum threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is cerebral malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Cerebral malaria occurs when parasite infected blood blocks capillaries or small blood vessels supplying blood to brain. This can result in damage and swelling of the brain. It can be life-threatening and person may enter state of coma.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms of malaria can be severe and start to show within 10 days to four weeks of infection. Some patients may not even develop symptoms for longer duration of time as plasmodium parasite can remain dormant or inactive for long interval. If these symptoms are not treated, malaria can become a life-threatening disease. Hence, it is important not to ignore these symptoms. Some common symptoms of malaria have been enlisted below:\n",
      "\n",
      "High fever\n",
      "Frequent shaking chills\n",
      "Sweating\n",
      "Headache\n",

      "Cough\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the incubation period of different types of parasites?\n",
      "\n",
      "Incubation period is the duration between getting infected by parasite and exhibiting symptoms. Incubation period for different types of plasmodium parasites are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Plasmodium falciparum- 9 to 14 days.\n",
      "Plasmodium vivax- 12 to18 days, but may stay dormant for long period of time ranging from 8 months to 10 months or longer.\n",
      "Plasmodium malariae- 18 to 40 days.\n",
      "Plasmodium ovale – 12 to18 days.\n",
      "Plasmodium knowlesi- 9 to12 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is malaria diagnosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have been suffering from symptoms of malaria for more than a week, consult a doctor without any further delay. Early diagnosis will make your treatment easier and save your money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor will first perform physical examination and inquire about your family's medical history\n",
      "Questions regarding recent travel may as well be asked. If you have traveled to areas where there is high infection of malaria, chances of suffering from the disease are high.\n",
      "After that, doctor will ask you to go for blood test and RDT (Rapid Diagnostic Tests)\n",
      "Blood sample will be analyzed to check platelet count and amount of bilirubin in blood. Low platelet count and higher than normal level of bilirubin in blood are red flags of malaria.\n",
      "Malaria RTD's detect presence of particular proteins (antigens) produced by malarial parasites in blood sample. Some RTD's are able to detect few species of parasite while most of them can detect multiple parasite species.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the treatment for malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment for malaria depends on type of malaria causing parasite. There have been reports that some parasites have become resistant to drugs. Thus, increase in plasmodium parasite's resistance to medications has proved most of the medications ineffective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor may combine two or more treatments to cure malaria. There are no vaccinations against malaria, but research for developing one is going on. However, most of the cases of malaria are treated by using medications such as :\n",
      "\n",
      "Chloroquine (Aralen)\n",
      "Quinine sulfate (Qualaquin)\n",
      "Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)\n",
      "Mefloquine\n",
      "Combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone)\n",
      "\n",
      "Can one crush malaria tablets before consuming them?\n",
      "\n",
      "All the medications suggested by doctor have to be compulsorily taken on time and in exact proportion either with water or milk. Unless and until you have difficulty in swallowing tablets, do not crush tablets. Malarone tablet can be crushed into small pieces and mixed with condensed milk or water just before consuming it.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much time does it take to recover from malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment of malaria is subjected to number of factors that determine intensity of the disease. If more than one species of malaria causing parasites are found in blood sample, doctor will use multiple medications to cure it. This will prolong recovery time. Usually, it takes approximately two weeks of treatment to cure malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is a person with malaria contagious?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, malaria is a non-contagious disease. It cannot be transmitted by the medium of air and water and by touching. The only way it can be transmitted between human beings is through blood transfusion. If infected blood is transfused into the body of a healthy human being, blood of healthy person becomes contaminated with parasites and that person suffers from malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are precautionary measures for malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria can be prevented if you follow certain precautions. These precautions are mentioned below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Protect yourself from mosquito bites\n",
      "Take antimalarial tablets\n",
      "Avoid visiting areas where mosquitoes breed and multiply\n",
      "Avoid traveling to countries where malaria is prevalent\n",
      "Try to stay indoors during evening and night time. This is the period when mosquitoes are generally active.\n",
      "Wear long pants and long sleeved shirt to protect your body parts from mosquito bites\n",
      "Make use of insect repellent that contains DEET (N,N diethylmetatoluamide). It is not safe to use repellents containing 10% to 30% DEET on infants below the age of 2 months.\n",
      "Bed nets sprayed with insecticides like permethrin or deltamethrin act as protective agents from mosquitoes. However, due to constant spraying, mosquitoes have become acquainted with these insecticides and hence, less protection is offered.\n",
      "Do not store water in containers for more than 3-4 days. If you do so, keep the area surrounding containers clean. Mosquitoes breed extensively in area where there is combination of warmth and moisture. Also, expose these containers to bright sunlight for at least 15 minutes in a day. UV rays (ultraviolet rays) have the potential to kill harmful bacteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "In which areas of the world malaria is common?\n",
      "\n",
      "Areas that are more prone to malaria are:\n",
      "\n",
      "African counties\n",
      "Central America\n",
      "South America\n",
      "Whole of Asian continent\n",
      "Western pacific islands\n",
      "Papa New Guinea\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately, 20%-30% of population residing in these areas are infected by malaria. Even tourists who visit these places are at high risk of contracting malaria and hence, should consult with doctor before traveling to these areas. One may use antimalarial tablets and sprays and wear long clothing when visiting above mentioned places.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we reduce spread of malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria is a non-contagious disease. Hence, every individual should ensure that he takes necessary precautions to protect himself and his community members from malaria. Some tips to reduce spread of malaria are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Use mosquito repellent creams\n",
      "Install bed nets to protect yourself from mosquitoes when you are sleeping\n",
      "For more information, you can refer to question number 11\n",
      "\n",
      "What age group is most affected by malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Children under the age of five years are more vulnerable to malaria. In areas where there is high risk of malaria, children usually acquire partial immunity towards the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to prevent malaria in children?\n",
      "\n",
      "Children are more vulnerable to malaria as their resistance or immunity power is not too strong. To avoid malaria in children, they have to abstained from getting bitten by mosquitoes. If you are taking your child to parks or mosquito prone area, make sure you apply mosquito repellent cream to his exposed parts. Wear full length clothing for maximum protection. If in case there is a need for blood transfusion, parents must ensure that the donated blood is free of any parasites. Malaria can spread only through the medium of blood. Hence, mandatory precaution has to be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the cost of test for malaria?\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnostic tests to determine presence of malaria causing parasite may start from average INR 350. Cost of the test greatly varies depending on severity of the disease. Malaria test price is in the range of INR 200 to INR 700. For more information about cost of malaria test, click here.\n",

      "\n",
      "Identifying magnesium toxicity is difficult as most of the symptoms are generic and can be easily confused with other health disorders. However, the following can be taken as warning signs of Magnesium toxicity or Hypermagnesemia:\n",
      "\n",
      "Extreme fatigue \n",
      "Body pain \n",
      "Abnormal heart rates \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the clinical tests to know Magnesium levels in body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your doctor based on symptoms will order a serum magnesium test to determine abnormal levels of the element in body. The procedure involves drawing a small amount of blood and then testing it under laboratory conditions. Normal levels of magnesium rule out chances of magnesium deficiency and thus your doctor can take up other diagnostic tests to route the causes of your symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the cost of Serum Magnesium test in India?\n",
      "\n",
      "Serum Magnesium test is available in every diagnostic center across various cities in India. You may get a detailed information about the prices here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the other tests to undergo along with magnesium tests?\n",
      "\n",
      "Magnesium is closely related to calcium content in body (Ref Q. 8). Similarly, other elements such as Potassium and phosphate also influence test results. Therefore, following tests are ordered alongside Mg Test:\n",
      "\n",
      "Calcium test\n",
      "Phosphate Test\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does my skin tingle during magnesium oil massage?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tingling sensation during oil massage is normal. This shows that the body is extensively low on magnesium and therefore as the oil sips in the skin, tingling effects are felt. Massaging just after bath will reduce the effect as skin pores are open then. Gradually, the sensation disappears as the body becomes used to the oil and the levels of magnesium gets close to normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take to treat magnesium deficiency?\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as remedial steps are adopted, magnesium levels rise. Approximately, a few weeks time is sufficient; however, this varies according to the level of deficiency you suffer and the rate at which the body responds to treatment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options for Hypermagnesemia?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Menopause?\n",
      "Menopause is gradual, complete and irreversible cessation of monthly menstrual period following reduction in the levels of female reproductive hormones. It must be noted that missing regular periods for a month or two or even six months is not considered menopause. Medically, total absence of vaginal bleeding for 12 months at a stretch is known as menopause.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens during natural menstrual flow?\n",
      "Every female baby is born with a fixed number of eggs or ova. Over the years, eggs are stored in the ovaries, where they prepare for menstrual flow. \n",
      "\n",
      "When a girl reaches her puberty, first egg from any of the two ovaries gets completely matured and is released by the ovary. The egg travels through fallopian tube. During this span, the ovaries release a number of reproductive hormones. The egg that is released by any one of the ovary waits in the fallopian tube for about 24 hours. If sperm is introduced in the body, they may fertilize and thus produces a zygote. This marks pregnancy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The uterus lining thickens to prepare for any possible pregnancy, where the zygote transfers into a baby for over a period of 9 months. And if no fertilization takes place, the thickened wall breaks, and is released out of the body through vagina along with eggs. This is known as periods or menstrual flow. Every menstrual cycle is a period of 28 days; while periods can be anything from 2 to 7 days for every woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When happens during menopause?\n",
      "Menopause is a natural aging process where ovaries no longer release eggs or related female sex hormones. Once reaching menopause, a woman is no longer capable of getting pregnant; while being able to carry out with other normal functions easily. Menopause does come with some symptoms that are quite manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the ideal age for menopause?\n",
      "Every women reaches the state of menopause at some particular time depending on her health status and genes. The ideal age is around 51 years or so, However, women belonging to age groups 45 or above can also experience a natural menopause. \n",
      "\n",
      "If your mother or sister happens to experience menopause at some particular age, you can also expect the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the stages of menopause?\n",
      "Menopause has 3 different stages; namely;\n",
      "\n",
      "Perimenopause\n",
      "Menopause \n",
      "Postmenopause\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Perimenopause?\n",
      "\n",
      "Perimenopause is also termed as the end phase of menstruation. Women in perimenopause do not experience complete absence of periods, but have an irregular flow. Estrogen levels decline and so does their menstrual flow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perimenopause begins around 4 years prior to menopause. However, some women can even have 10 years of perimenopause phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the common symptoms of Perimenopause?\n",
      "Women in perimenopause experience the following symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot flashes – A sudden feeling of heat accompanied with sweat and redness of face. \n",
      "Tenderness of Breasts – Slight pain with touch, fast walking or any other time. \n",
      "Disturbed sex or a complete disinterest \n",
      "Irregular periods \n",
      "Reduced control on urine; especially, during coughing or sneezing\n",
      "Irritation and mood swings \n",
      "Disturbed sleep or changed sleeping pattern \n",
      "Dry vagina \n",
      "A general feeling of weakness\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How can you know if your perimenopause symptoms are a part of natural menopause or an underlying disease?\n",
      "Irregular flow is a common symptom that comes along with perimenopause. However, if you are having heavy period flow, it is best to visit the doctor to know that this irregularity is brought about by perimenopause changes and not by other health disorders; such as, cancer, wrong birth control pills etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, if you are experiencing spotting between periods or your periods happen to be very frequent, it's better you visit a doctor, and not ignore them as early menopause symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is scanty period a sign of perimenopause?\n",
      "Yes, reduced period flow suggests that the body is entering into the menopause phase. For reasons obvious, as ovulation decreases, your uterus wall weakens and does not develop properly. Thus, there is a related decrease in menstrual bleeding. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there can be many other factors that can lead to reduced menses. Therefore, if you think that it is too early for you to get into this menopause phase, and you are still experiencing scanty periods, it is best to visit a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the common symptoms of Menopause?\n",
      "Women entering menopause experience a number of physical and mental changes. A wide variety of symptoms exist, that determine menopause in women. Some of them have been listed below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot flashes become more prominent during nights: \n",
      "Hot flashes that existed since the perimenopause phase now appear to become more prominent. Hot flashes arise as a response of the body towards reduced estrogen production. \n",
      "Women complain of a constant feeling of heat, that becomes more evident from the redness around cheeks and mild sweating. In women who have a gradual decrease in estrogen levels, hot flashes are more or less manageable. However, for women who have an abrupt decline of estrogen levels, hot flashes and related night sweats become very annoying and may hinder a good night's sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete lack of libido: \n",
      "Any individual may have changes in sexual desire or libido. However, menopause that brings about hormonal imbalance and vaginal dryness suddenly makes a women lose sexual desire completely. Lack of androgen is the primary reason behind libido or reduced sexual desires. \n",
      "\n",
      "Intense mood swings: \n",
      "Mood swings now become very intense and frequent. A woman herself is not in a position to explain her emotional ups and downs. She is extremely sensitive and tends to get irritated soon. It is here that she needs support and care from her partner and family members. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thinning hair and brittle nails: \n",
      "As the body experiences hormonal imbalances, hair and nails tend to become very fragile. However, there can be other reasons that bring about such symptoms and it's wise to discuss with your doctor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Broadened waist lines: \n",
      "Weight gain or more precisely broadened waist lines is a prominent symptom of Menopause. As levels of hormones change, metabolic rates also change. The body tries to retain fat cells to compensate for reduced estrogen. \n",
      "However, weight gain during menopause can be managed by bringing in related dietary changes and some physical exercises. \n",
      "\n",
      "Abnormal Bloating: \n",
      "Bloating refers to a condition where women have an accumulation of intestinal gas, resulting in swelling of lower abdomen, tightness and pain. Some women may experience few days of bloating after which it disappears. Again, some women can experience continuous and prolonged bloating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unexplained allergies: \n",
      "Due to sudden reduction of hormones, allergies become very common with menopausal women. Some women tend to turn allergic to food items that were never a source of trouble earlier. Again some may experience skin rashes, sneezing and redness of eyes. Severe allergic bout needs to be discussed with doctors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Body odor that never existed earlier: \n",
      "Women often get extremely troubled when they suddenly realize that they are having a bad body odor and nothing seems to work. Body odor arises as there is excess sweating due to hot flashes. However, you can talk to your doctor if this is really bothering you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do women suffer from bloating during menopause?\n",
      "Women suffer from bloating because the body lacks bile necessary for healthy intestinal functions. Estrogen levels govern bile secretions. Therefore, when the body has reduced estrogen, there will be a relative change in bile production; leading to bloating and other related problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens post menopause?\n",
      "When a woman does not have any form of vaginal bleeding for a year, she is said to have attained menopause. Post menopause, symptoms tend to be less severe in most cases. However, some women do continue with disturbing after effects of menopause; such as vaginal dryness and hot flashes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Weight gain remains a major concern post menopause and only those who can bring about the necessary life style changes, do enjoy a happy and less stressful post menopause period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the factors that can lead to early menopause?\n",
      "\n",
      "Menarch and menopause, both have a fixed age to happen. However, there are a couple of factors that lead to early menopause in women. Some of them are:\n",
      "Family History: Medical experts say that if the women in your family have been showing an early menopause, you become prone to attain the same. Daughters are six times more prone to early menopause if their mothers have had the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smoking can lead to early menopause: Studies have shown that women who are in the habit of smoking, experience much early menopause as compared to their non smoking counter parts with almost similar health status. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thin women have a greater chance of early menopause: Fat cells store estrogen necessary for healthy menstruation. Therefore, very thin women who have a lack of fat cells have related restriction of estrogen and thus attain an early menopause. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ovarian disease: Women suffering from some kind of ovarian disorders such as cyst or cancer, remain more susceptible to an early menopause. However, proper treatment through medication can eliminate the chances upto a great extent. Surgical removal of ovaries or uterus drives a woman to menopause. \n",
      "\n",
      "Epilepsy leading to Ovarian Failure: Researchers state that women who have epilepsy history are very likely to reach early menopause as the disease affects ovarian failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Should I be worried if I have chances of early menopause?\n",
      "Reaching menopause at a time when you don't have plans of ending your fertility is definitely a great reason to worry about. Besides, reduced production of estrogen can have other health concerns. Some of them are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart Disease: Estrogen helps the body to maintain good cholesterol in body. Therefore, a body lacking in estrogen becomes prone to several heart disorders. \n",
      "Osteoporosis: Estrogen is equally important for bone health. Absence of which makes women susceptible to osteoporosis and other bone disorders.\n",
      "Depression: Reaching an early menopause drives you into different menopausal symptoms and thus gives sufficient reasons to worry about and feel depressed. \n",
      "Other health disorders, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can early menopause prevent breast cancer?\n",
      "Breast cancer is estrogen sensitive. Women who enter late menopause or begin early, remain exposed to estrogen for greater duration. Thus, the chances of these women to develop breast cancer is greater as compared to those who attain early menopause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options for early menopause?\n",
      "An FSH Test confirms that you have attained early menopause. However, for those who are worried about their infertility, can definitely opt for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). \n",
      "\n",
      "HRT is helpful in dealing with early menopause; however, increases the chances of other health disorders. If you want to have your own baby despite menopause, opting for IVF Treatment is one of the most effective steps you can opt for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you have sex after menopause?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! Although many women experience lesser sexual drive post menopause, if you do have a libido you can definitely go ahead. There are no health concerns related to sex after menopause. However, getting pregnant is no longer possible now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is menopause painful?\n",
      "No. Menopause is not painful. However, the number of symptoms accompanying the phase are definitely very stressful. Vaginal dryness sometimes makes women feel slight pain around the area.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean by Osteoarthritis?\n",
      "Osteoarthritis is a disease of joints affecting the cartilage, which is a slippery tissue covering bone ends in joints. Healthy cartilage facilitates gliding of bones and also helps in absorbing movement shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a person suffers from osteoarthritis, the top cartilage layer breaks and wears out. This leads to bones below cartilage to rub against each other and cause swelling, pain and motion loss of the concerned joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What the most common types of Osteoarthritis?\n",
      "Though osteoarthritis can affect joints of any body part, the most commonly known types are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Knee osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis affects both the knees with time, once it has affected any one of the knees. The exception to this is occurrence of this ailment due to injury or some other condition that affects just one knee.\n",
      "Affected knees will experience pain while walking; especially when climbing stairs or ascending and descending hills. Straightening of legs becomes difficult and a grating sound can be heard while moving affected joint. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hip osteoarthritis: Difficulty in moving hip joints is the primary sign of hip osteoarthritis. Usually groin pain is experienced by affected individuals. This pain will be worse while moving hip joints. For example, difficulty while wearing socks or putting on shoes are signs of this ailment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hand osteoarthritis: Base of thumb, closest joints to fingertips and finger's middle joints are affected by this osteoarthritis type. Fingers may get swollen, painful and stiff and finger joints may witness development of bumps on them. Though pain decreases and disappears eventually, swelling and bumps might remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finger might slightly bend at sides at affected joints and painful cysts may develop at back side of fingers. For some patients, bumps may develop at base of thumb; right at the spot where it connects with the wrist. Even manual tasks such as opening jars and writing can get difficult due to hand osteoarthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the signs and symptoms of Osteoarthritis?\n",
      "The common signs and symptoms for osteoarthritis are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tenderness in joints\n",
      "Increased stiffness and pain if joints are not moved for some time\n",
      "Slightly large appearance of joints than usual\n",
      "Crackling or grating sound in joints\n",
      "Limited movement of joints\n",
      "Bulk muscle loss (muscle wasting) and weakness\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different tests suggested to diagnose osteoarthritis?\n",
      "Tests for diagnosing osteoarthritis are not definitive. Doctors examine joints and symptoms before coming to a final conclusion. Some tests that may be suggested include:\n",
      "\n",
      "X- Rays\n",
      "MRI\n",
      "Blood tests (for checking causes that lead to osteoarthritis; such as rheumatoid arthritis)\n",
      "Synovial Fluid Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the costs of tests for osteoarthritis in India?\n",
      "Costs of tests for osteoarthritis in India will depend on various factors such as your city of residence, type of hospital/diagnostic center you visit and facilities you avail of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes/risk factors that lead to osteoarthritis?\n",
      "Various factors that contribute towards increasing risk for developing osteoarthritis include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Joint injury: If your joint is damaged during operation or injury, osteoarthritis can develop in it. It is recommended that overuse of joint before giving it ample time to heal post operation or injury needs to be avoided to keep osteoarthritis at bay.\n",
      "Secondary arthritis: Previously existing condition of the joint such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis can lead to development of osteoarthritis. Post initial damage done to joints, osteoarthritis may occur many years later.\n",
      "Ageing: With increasing age, the risk of osteoarthritis rises too. Adults crossing the age of 45 years are at higher risk.\n",
      "Inheritance: Family history of osteoarthritis may also be a cause of this disease in some cases. As studies in genetics have not found a specific responsible gene, many genes together contribute in small proportions towards developing osteoarthritis via inheritance.\n",
      "Obesity: Obesity leads to putting additional strain on joints; especially joints of hips and knees that bear weight most of the time.\n",
      "Vitamin D deficiency: Deficiency of Vitamin D can aggravate existing osteoarthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What can you do for prevention of osteoarthritis?\n",
      "Though completely eliminating the possibility of developing osteoarthritis cannot be achieved, decreasing risk can be done by following the below mentioned aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Care for your joints:\n",
      "Exercise regularly: Though regular exercise leads to healthy joints, straining joints; especially those at knees, hands and hips, needs to be avoided. So instead of weight training and running, you can opt for cycling and swimming that are considered better options when it comes to prevention of damage to joints.\n",
      "Good posture: Maintaining this is extremely important. Do not stay is one position for long duration. If at work desks, ensure that the chair you sit on is at right height. Regular breaks are necessary to easy your muscles are are highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure muscles are kept strong:\n",
      "Engaging in aerobic activities such as brisk walking and cycling for strengthening muscles is recommended. Again, remember to avoid straining joints while you enjoy these activities.\n",
      "Lose weight:\n",
      "Talk to your doctor or a professional dietitian for weight loss. Obesity is bad and can definitely lead to developing osteoarthritis. Moreover, being obese can lead to other medical ailments as well. So maintaining correct weight is crucial for your health.\n",

      "Following are common questions about Osteoporosis:\n",
      "\n",
      "What is osteoporosis?\n",
      "How do you develop osteoporosis?\n",
      "What are the symptoms of osteoporosis?\n",
      "What suggests that you are definitely at a high risk of osteoporosis?\n",

      "What are the types of osteoporosis?\n",
      "What are the symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis?\n",
      "Is juvenile osteoporosis treatable?\n",
      "How can you prevent osteoporosis?\n",
      "Can osteoarthrits lead to osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoporosis is a kind of bone disorder causing it to become very soft and brittle. Bones usually have honeycomb like structure; however, when osteoporosis occurs, the size of holes in the honeycomb structure become larger than normal and thus loose density and become brittle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The body periodically generates new bones to replace the old and worn out ones. However, in osteoporosis, this does not happen. The body either fails to generate new bone or the breakdown is too rapid and abnormal.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you develop osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are multiple factors causing osteoporosis. Few of them have been discussed below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetics and family history: It has been seen that osteoporosis runs in family. Patients having their parents or grandparents suffering from this bone disorder, remain likely to suffer from osteoporosis. However, this is something that can be prevented. Opting for regular bone health checkups can definitely help you determine early signs and opt for treatment measures.\n",
      "Medications: Certain medications are known to have detrimental effect on our bones. Prolonged use of steroids can weaken your bones. Cancer treatment that impacts hormonal balance in the body can again push you at a high risk of this disease.\n",
      "Poor diet: People who have been following wrong diet plans are prone to suffer from osteoporosis at later stages of life. Particularly, a lack of calcium and vitamin D intake can disturb your bone health.\n",
      "Sedentary lifestyle: Exercises and physical activities are vital for having strong bones. However, people who follow a sedentary lifestyle make their bones become weaker slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the above mentioned factors, there are a number of other parameters, such as age, gender and body frame that can make you equally susceptible to the disease. Old generation is more prone to this disease. Women; especially those who have a thin structure, can develop the disease. Health issues such as thyroid troubles can lead to osteoporosis at later stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoporosis does not come up with vivid symptoms. The disease is a gradual process and at early stages you don't really identify weakening of your bones. It is only after a considerable period that you may experience symptoms of bone disorder:\n",
      "\n",
      "Severe back ache\n",
      "A continuous and blunt pain around bone joints\n",
      "Unexpected fractures that become frequent\n",
      "Bent posture\n",
      "Diminished height determined only on tests and not visible with naked eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "What suggests that you are definitely at a high risk of osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be great to know the first sign of osteoporosis. However, as already mentioned, osteoporosis has no early symptoms. It is only when you test yourself, you may know that your bones are in a bad state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, below mentioned are few of the subtle signals that can reveal a deteriorating bone health, or a probable Osteoporosis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin D deficiency symptoms\n",
      "Abnormal results in serum calcium test or alkaline phosphatase test\n",
      "Not being able to get up from a seated position without using your hands. And this does not mean that you are seated on the floor. If you experience this while sitting on a chair, opt for a bone density test immediately.\n",
      "Your spine appears to take up a curved structure\n",
      "Abnormal pulse rates detected in a test\n",
      "If you are already obese, you need to take care as the extra weight can exert excess pressure on your bones\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the diagnosis options for osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoporosis or any bone disorder can be diagnosed through a multiple of laboratory procedures. Some of them are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone density tests\n",
      "Blood Marker Tests\n",
      "Urine tests to know nutrient levels\n",
      "Dual Energy X ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)\n",
      "Calcium test and Vitamin D test\n",
      "Imaging tests may also be required\n",
      "\n",
      "What is pre osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pre osteoporosis is known as osteopenia, a condition where a person has been detected with weak bones, but has not developed osteoporosis yet. A bone density test can detect osteopenia. People who are diagnosed with osteopenia gain an upper hand, as taking up measures to prevent osteoporosis is feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options of osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment of osteoporosis depends on how severe are your symptoms and the chances of your bone ruptures. Medication, diet and physical exercises together can help in treating the condition. However, if the associated risk is lower, medications may be skipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medications sometimes are thought to bring about related side effects. Therefore, people who opt for early diagnosis through regular screening tests, can get treated through nutritional and lifestyle change without depending on medicines. However, for people diagnosed at later stages, drugs become inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the dietary recommendations for people suffering from osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals suffering from osteoporosis need to opt for a well balanced diet. A good diet acts as an effective natural treatment for osteoporosis or any other bone disorder. Calcium and Vitamin D rich foods are mandatory to be included in the diet. Below suggested is an osteoporosis diet plan that may be useful:\n",
      "\n",
      "Milk and Dairy products, such as yoghurt, cheese etc.\n",
      "A mixed bag of fruits\n",
      "Fresh and green leafy vegetables - cabbage, fennel, broccoli etc. are some of the good options\n",
      "Dry fruits such as figs and apricots, nuts\n",
      "Soya bean and soya drinks may be useful. But discuss this with your doctor.\n",
      "Fishes with bones and oil\n",
      "Cereals\n",
      "Water - 3 to 5 liters each day\n",
      "\n",
      "What should you not eat while undergoing treatment for osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduce salt intake\n",
      "Restrict alcohol consumption. Soft drinks may also be avoided.\n",
      "Caffeine - coffee and tea\n",
      "Refrain from smoking\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the types of osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoporosis has been divided into two broad types; primary osteoporosis and secondary osteoporosis.\n",
      "Primary osteoporosis can be divided into - Post menopausal osteoporosis, Idiopathic Osteoporosis and Involutional osteoporosis\n",
      "Secondary osteoporosis is a condition that relates to weakened bone due to other health disorders\n",
      "Menopause affects the bone health adversely and therefore, females need to take good care in their pre and post menopausal stages\n",
      "Idiopathic osteoporosis relates to bone disorder seen in children. It is also known as Juvenile osteoporosis\n",
      "Involutional refers to bone health degradation due to aging and poor diet or lifestyle\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of juvenile osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs and symptoms related to osteoporosis that your child may show is no different from what you may exhibit. Visit a pediatric orthopedic surgeon if your child complains about the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Extreme fatigue and irritation\n",
      "Constant pain around the limbs\n",
      "Reluctant to play outdoor\n",
      "Frequent fractures around ankles\n",
      "Severe back pain\n",
      "Having problems while walking\n",
      "Not being able to follow correct postures\n",
      "\n",
      "Is juvenile osteoporosis treatable?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no direct treatment for idiopathic/juvenile osteoporosis. If your child has reached this stage due to some other diseased condition, treating that disease can be a remedy. You will have to talk to your GP to know what you could do to minimize adversities and help your child lead a normal life. A good diet can definitely work miracles.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can you prevent osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventing osteoporosis requires a life time of commitment. As already mentioned, osteoporosis does not come up with vivid symptoms at early stages. So, even when you are already having weakened bone, you may not know it. Therefore, taking care of your bone health right from the beginning is what can guarantee osteoporosis prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Healthy eating habits - A good diet always provides necessary nutrients to your body that never lets your bones take a weak shape. It is important to know healthy levels of calcium and vitamin D required for your body depending on age group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular exercises - Every individual needs to opt for some kind of physical activities to keep bones in a healthy state. A bit of jogging, yoga, sports etc. should be a part of our regular day to day life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being vigilant about your health status - Osteoporosis may develop as a result of some other health issues as well. Therefore, make efforts for knowing how the vital organs of your body are doing. Patients suffering from pancreatic troubles, thyroid disorders or have been detected with tumors in the past, need to opt for blood sugar testing, Thyroid testing and tumor or cancer screenings regularly can help to prevent these diseases from affecting your bone health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Females need to opt for periodic health checkups - As women remain at a greater risk of this disease, bone density tests are performed as one of the mandatory tests in any of the screening packages offered by diagnostic centers. Opting for those can help guarantee osteoporosis prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teaching children about correct postures - Following a right posture is essential to not stress your bones unduly. Therefore, right from a tender age, you can take steps at teaching the right postures to your children, that can guarantee strong bones in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can osteoarthrits lead to osteoporosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoarthritis is a condition affecting bone joints. On the other hand, osteoporosis makes bones fragile. Although, both come with similar symptoms, they are in true sense two different medical conditions and varied causatives. Now, both these conditions do not work as causative factors for each other. However, your doctor will be at the best position to explain consequences. You can learn more about arthritis here.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the test rates for Ovarian Cancer diagnosis in India?\n",
      "Rates of tests for ovarian cancer diagnosis may vary depending on where your live in India, type of diagnostic center you visit, or the hospital from where you get those tests done. You can find the charges of test in various Indian cities here.\n",
      "What are the common symptoms of this disease?\n",
      "Early detection is difficult for ovarian cancer. Suffering women show completely negative to mild symptoms till advanced stage is reached. However, some symptoms include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Abnormal discharge or bleeding from vagina\n",
      "Frequent urination, diarrhea or constipation\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different treatment methods for Ovarian Cancer?\n",
      "Mostly patients who suffer from ovarian cancer need to undergo surgery. Various surgery types are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hysterectomy: Fallopian tubes, cervix, uterus and ovaries are removed\n",
      "Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: One each of fallopian tubes and ovaries is removed\n",

      "Though there has been significant progress in survival rates for cervical and breast cancer, mortality for ovarian cancer has not seen any considerable positive change. Lack of progress with regards to early detection is the major cause for this. The rates of survival for ovarian cancer are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "If detected in early stages, 90% success\n",
      "Late detection due to unavailability of accurate diagnosis early on, results in 75% patients being diagnosed during advanced stage\n",
      "Long term rate of survival for ovarian cancer in its advanced stage is just 10%\n",
      "1 year rate of survival post diagnosis is 75%\n",

      "Reviewed By : Dr. Anjali D.\n",
      "Following are common questions about Piles:\n",
      "\n",
      "What are Piles (Hemorrhoids)?\n",
      "What causes Piles?\n",
      "What risk factors are associated with Piles?\n",
      "What is the difference between internal and external Piles?\n",
      "What are different types of Piles?\n",
      "Which are the symptoms of Piles?\n",

      "How squatting helps prevent Piles?\n",
      "Which precautions are required to be taken while using laxatives for Piles treatment?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are Piles (Hemorrhoids)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemorrhoids are blood vessels surrounding the smooth muscles. Pathologically, “Hemorrhoids” are termed as coagulated blood lumps formed due to swelling and inflammation. This happens as a result of pressure being exerted on these blood vessels.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes Piles? \n",
      "The exact reasons behind the occurrence of piles remain unknown. In case of piles, the blood vessels become thin and stretched, which leads to bleeding. This happens due to forceful activity of blood vessels against gravity for getting the blood back to the heart which is also known as venous return. Due to intra-abdominal pressure, blood vessels are displaced below and formation of hemorrhoids takes place.\n",
      "What risk factors are associated with Piles? \n",
      "The risk factors associated with the occurrence of Piles are discussed below.\n",
      "Aging:\n",
      "Piles consists of different parts, such as mucosa lining, vein and smooth muscle cluster and supporting connective tissue. With aging, deterioration of the supporting tissues takes place. This results in prolapse of piles. Mucosal lining becomes more sensitive with age, to the pressure from straining and may lead to complications.\n",
      "Chronic constipation and diarrhea:\n",
      "Constipation is a condition where straining is needed for bowel movements to pass hard stools. Inward pressure is generated on the hemorrhoids due to the hard stools and leads to troubles in the process of venous return. While outward pressure from abdomen and pelvic muscles causes formation of swollen hemorrhoids. Excessive use of laxative for constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome treatment may lead to hemorrhoid disease.\n",
      "Obesity:\n",
      "Obesity is another risk factor in the formation of piles. Sitting for longer period of time, lack of physical activities, can lead to obesity and further piles. The risk of piles is prevented with the physical activity, since it promotes strengthening of abdominal muscles as well as colon walls. Exercises such as aerobics help improving blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract which ultimately helps in venous return improvement. \n",
      "Pregnancy:\n",
      "Piles get formed during pregnancy as a result of hormonal changes making the veins relax. Piles can be itchy and painful. It has been reported that piles may disappear within few weeks after childbirth. \n",
      "Diet and lifestyle:\n",
      "Diet and lifestyle can also be reasons behind generation of piles. Low-fiber diet, alcohol consumption, excessive spicy food consumption, can contribute formation of piles. Low-fiber diet can lead to constipation while spicy food and alcohol may cause diarrhea. In both cases piles get formed.\n",
      "What is the difference between internal and external Piles?\n",
      "Piles get formed inside or outside the anus. Internal Piles or hemorrhoids are those which originate above the dentate line while external hemorrhoids are the ones which originate below the dentate line.\n",
      "What are different types of Piles?\n",
      "Types of Piles or hemorrhoids are given below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grade I or First-degree hemorrhoids – these piles do not prolapse.\n",
      "Grade I or First-degree hemorrhoids – these piles do not prolapse.\n",
      "Grade II or Second-degree hemorrhoids – these piles prolapse on straining.\n",
      "Grade III or Third-degree hemorrhoids – these piles prolapse on straining.\n",
      "Grade IV or Fourth-degree hemorrhoids – these type of piles get permanently prolapsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which are the symptoms of Piles?\n",
      "Piles occur more commonly in young or middle-aged adults. Symptoms of Piles are listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Itchiness around the anus\n",
      "Blood in the stools\n",
      "Presence of pain during defecation \n",
      "Presence of hard lump around the anus\n",
      "Discharge of mucus while emptying the bowels \n",
      "Sore and red anus\n",
      "Sense of fullness in the anus; even after going to the toilet\n",
      "\n",
      "How diagnosis of Piles is carried out?\n",
      "Piles are usually diagnosed by a physician based on the symptoms told by the patients. The physical examination usually involves back passage examination. With the use of lubricant by wearing gloves, physician examines the back passage for signs of piles. \n",
      "When piles are not obvious after physical examination, further examination called Proctoscopy is recommended. In proctoscopic examination, a proctoscope is used, which involves a short hollow tube with a light at one end. Proctoscope helps in examining the back passage  lining more clearly for confirming presence of piles. \n",

      "In most of the cases, piles may resolve on their own. Timely treatments can help in \treducing the discomfort significantly. Dietary and lifestyle changes can help in reducing pain and irritation. Straining on the toilet needs to be avoided to reduce the piles pain. Methods for treating the piles are described below.\n",
      "Treating piles with medicaments:\n",
      "Over-the-counter topical medications, such as ointments, creams as well as suppositories are recommended for piles pain relief. These are no-prescription drugs. Self medication is not recommended in severe cases of piles where further treatments are required.\n",
      "Corticosteroid creams which contain steroid can be used for treating inflammation around the anus area. Since these creams contain steroids, prolong use is not recommended as it can enhance the irritation. Painkillers such as acetaminophen are used for pain-relief. \n",
      "In case of excessive bleeding in piles, use of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) need to be avoided as they may worsen bleeding. Laxatives are recommended to get relief from the constipation which is a root cause of piles most of the times. They help in emptying of bowels.\n",
      "Banding:\n",
      "The process of banding involves tightening the piles or hemorrhoids with the help of elastic band to cut off blood supply. It is expected that hemorrhoids fall off after this process within a week. This is a day's process and no anesthetic is required. Patients can get back to work the next day after the banding process. Some pain and discomfort can be felt after the process which can be reduced with use of painkillers.\n",
      "When hemorrhoids fall off, patients may not realize it as they are supposed to pass out of the body after going to the toilet. Presence of mucus discharge within one week period after the banding process indicates that the piles or hemorrhoid have fallen off.\n",
      "Sclerotherapy:\n",
      "Sclerothearpy is an alternative treatment used to cure hemorrhoids. A chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels during this process in the back passage of the patient. This aids in relieving pain by making the nerves numb from the site of action, i.e., back passage. The size of piles gets reduced after about four to six weeks from this treatment. Heavy exercise is not recommended post treatment. One can return back to routine activities soon after the treatment. \n",
      "Electrotherapy:\n",
      "This method is used to treat smaller sized piles and is also known as electrocoagulation. A device called proctoscope is used during Electrotherapy.\n",
      "A proctoscope is inserted inside the anus for confirming the location of piles or hemorrhoids. An electric current is passed by the specialist to the piles using proper procedure with the aid of controls attached to a metal probe placed at the base of piles. This treatment can be carried out on an outpatient basis with low electric current. A higher dose is given when anesthesia or spinal anesthesia is used. Electrocoagulation process can be somewhat painful but the pain does not last for long time. Rectal bleeding may occur as a side effect of this method for short period. \n",
      "Sometimes it can be used as an alternative to surgical methods.\n",
      "Stapled hemorrhoidopexy:\n",
      "This method involves cutting a circular section of the anal lining canal above the piles with the aid of a circular stapling gun. This helps in pulling the piles back up the anal canal. This process also reduces blood supply to the piles which results in their shrinkage. Since the cutting process takes place above the piles, it is less painful. \n",
      "Surgical treatments:\n",
      "Piles are treated with surgical methods when their severity is high. Surgery is recommended for piles formed below the dentate line. Different types of surgeries are carried out which involve removal of piles and can help the patient get rid of pain and discomfort.\n",
      "How to cope up with Piles during pregnancy?\n",
      "Piles can be made less severe during pregnancy by making some dietary and lifestyle changes. These changes can help ease the piles pain and irritations. Given below are the changes to be made to ease piles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consuming high-fiber diet\n",
      "Drinking plenty of water\n",
      "Avoid long period in standing position \n",
      "Improvement of circulation with regular exercise\n",
      "Use of ice water dipped cloth to ease the piles pain\n",
      "Application of lubricants for gentle pushing of piles inside the anus\n",
      "Avoiding straining while defecating as much as possible\n",
      "Making use of moist toilet paper for cleaning the anus, instead of dry one \n",
      "\n",
      "What are the complications associated with Piles?\n",
      "Most of the times, patients feel embarrassed to seek medical treatment for piles. It is recommended to consult doctors when symptoms of piles are noted.\n",
      "Following complications may occur due to untreated piles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Infection\n",
      "Anal fistula\n",
      "Gangrene\n",
      "Incontinence in rare cases\n",
      "Anemia due to excessive blood loss\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a loss of bowel control after Piles or Hemorrhoid surgery?\n",
      "It is rare to observe loss of bowel control post piles or hemorrhoid surgery. Loss of bowel control occurs only when there is a sphincter damage.\n",
      "In piles surgery, the extra tissue causing piles bleeding is removed with surgical treatment. Stapling process can also be used to block the blood flow so as to get rid of hemorrhoid as a consequence of it. Sphincter fibers are muscles that control the opening of anal movements. If this sphincter gets damaged, patients may need to replace it with artificial anal sphincters. In such cases, patient can lose bowel control.\n",
      "What are home remedies for Piles?\n",
      "Once diagnosis of piles is confirmed, some home remedies are used for reducing the symptoms of piles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinking more water\n",
      "Consuming high-fiber food\n",
      "Making use of Cumin seeds to treat the Piles\n",
      "Use of Isabgol\n",
      "Using ice packs\n",
      "Use of Sesame seeds \n",
      "Consumption of Onion juice\n",
      "Radish juice remedy\n",
      "\n",
      "How squatting helps prevent Piles?\n",
      "Squatting involves bending of knees towards the chest similar to yoga position where pressure can be felt on the abdomen. This helps normal defecation process without need of strain. Since legs are bent at the hips and knees are touching the chest during squatting process, most of the work is done by gravity. This further stimulates the body to initiate process of moving the waste matter towards colon, rectum and to the anus finally.\n",
      "Which precautions are required to be taken while using laxatives for Piles treatment?\n",
      "For treatment of constipation, laxatives are used. There are different types of laxatives, such as stimulant laxatives, saline laxatives and osmotic laxatives\n",
      "Stimulant laxatives are  those which induce bowel movements by enhancing  the contraction rate of muscles in the intestines, and are effective only for a short term.  Example of these laxatives include Bisacodyl, Senna compounds, Cascara and Aloe.\n",
      "Points to be considered while using stimulant laxatives are listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large dose of stimulant laxatives may lead to adverse effects.\n",
      "Side effects of using stimulant laxative can include dehydration, blood electrolyte disturbances, cramps and malnutrition. \n",
      "There is possibility of loss of colon function as a result of long term use of stimulant laxatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Magnesium, citrate, sulfate and phosphate ions are the commonly used active ingredients in saline laxatives. These ions are responsible for drawing water into the intestines. This additional water helps in softening the stools and ultimately increase the intestinal contractions which leads to easier defecation process. \n",
      "Saline laxatives should not be used in some patients due to absorption of active ingredients from the intestines into blood circulation. Saline laxatives in small doses are sometimes advised for the treatment of  constipation, since larger doses may lead to complete evacuation of the intestine. The active ingredient in osmotic-type laxatives, such as GoLYTELY, MiraLax  and GlycoLax are the active ingredients in osmotic laxatives. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Pneumonia?\n",
      "Pneumonia is a chronic lung disease, causing inflammation of alveoli or air sacs in the lungs. During this condition, the air sacs get filled with fluid or pus and this disturbs normal breathing phenomenon. It can be experienced in one or both lungs, and therefore known as single or double pneumonia respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you get pneumonia?\n",
      "Breathing in air containing germs causing pneumonia may lead to this lung disorder. When a person inhales in air containing bacteria and viruses, these parasitic organisms find their way into the respiratory tract. The body's immune system sends in antibodies to fight and eliminate foreign entities. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, when the immune system fails to fight back germs, the parasitic organisms settle within the air sacs and multiply. As the body still continues to fight back germs, a fluid or pus is released, blocking the alveoli and thus leading to pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the types of pneumonia?\n",
      "Pneumonia can be classified on the basis of where and how the causative germs enter our body, or the part of the lungs that gets affected:\n",
      "Types of pneumonia – How the germs have entered our body:\n",
      "\n",
      "Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) \n",
      "Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) \n",
      "Healthcare acquired pneumonia (HCAP) \n",
      "Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) \n",
      "Aspiration – A condition where foreign materials (food, saliva, nasal secretions) enter the bronchial tree \n",
      "\n",
      "Types of pneumonia – Depending on the part of lungs affected:\n",

      "Lobar pneumonia\n",
      "Bronchial pneumonia\n",
      "Acute interstitial pneumonia \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortness of breath \n",
      "Fast breathing – more than 45 breaths per minute \n",
      "Bluish discoloration of skin, fingertips and toenails \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is at a high risk of getting pneumonia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Excessive smoking and alcoholism lead to the most common reasons of CAP \n",
      "Severe cold or influenza may lead to viral pneumonia \n",
      "Infants below 1 year and adults above 65 years remain at highest risk of pneumonia \n",
      "Other medical condition – HIV, COPD or Asthma \n",
      "Have a weak immune system or being malnourished \n",
      "Continuous and prolonged exposure to certain industrial pollutants \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are people living in cold climatic conditions more prone to pneumonia?\n",
      "Pneumonia is not related to weather conditions. People living in cold areas mostly stay indoors to keep themselves warm. As they do not come in contact with fresh air and sunlight too often, bacteria growth becomes easier. Thus, making them susceptible to pneumonia. Again, people living in tropical regions already have hot climatic conditions favorable for bacterial growth. Thus, pneumonia is equally common in these areas as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is pneumonia fatal?\n",
      "Pneumonia is usually not fatal and can be treated with timely diagnosis and administering effective remedies. However, virus infected pneumonia in children and elderly people may prove fatal if proper and quick treatment measures are not opted for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What tests will you doctor order to confirm pneumonia?\n",
      "Early symptoms of pneumonia can be very misleading as they are very common to any other lung disorder such as asthma. However, you are required to see a doctor if you are having any of the above mentioned symptoms (Refer to Question 4). \n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor may suggest the following tests:\n",
      "\n",
      "Chest X Ray\n",
      "Blood test\n",
      "A CT Scan of your chest\n",
      "Sputum test to examine the mucous\n",

      "Bronchoscopy\n",
      "Pleural fluid culture\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How is pneumonia treated?\n",
      "Pneumonia that has been diagnosed at an early stage can easily be treated with antibiotics and adequate rest. Infants detected with pneumonia may have to spend a night or two in hospitals to eliminate any chances of severity. Drinking plenty of fluids while in this condition is extremely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the recovery period of pneumonia?\n",
      "Patients suffering from severe pneumonia require 4- 6 months time, getting back to normal. This implies coming back to the most healthy version of themselves. However, reduction in intensity of symptoms can be experienced right after the medicines have been administered. Very severe pneumonia may have the following staged improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a week's time, you are no longer suffering from fever\n",
      "Cough and mucous production is completely resolved by a month's time \n",
      "Around the 6th week post medication, you will no longer experience breathlessness or similar difficulties \n",
      "After 3 months, you only feel a little tired while all other symptoms have disappeared \n",
      "Around the 6th month, you are completely back to your normal life with no signs of pneumonia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is pneumonia contagious?\n",
      "No. Pneumonia as a disease is not contagious. However, germs causing this disease are free to travel from one person to another. Therefore, people who are already at a high risk of pneumonia; as for example a person with weakened immune system should not be in close contact with pneumonia patients; especially those suffering from bronchial pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is double pneumonia more dangerous than single pneumonia?\n",
      "Well it is conveniently believed that double pneumonia is more difficult. However, this is not completely true as severe single pneumonia can prove to be more dangerous than chronic double pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can pneumonia lead to other health disorders?\n",
      "Yes pneumonia may sometimes lead to further complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacteremia – Bacteria causing pneumonia may enter the blood steam and pass to other organs and rarely lead to organ failure\n",
      "Extremely difficult breathing, requiring ventilation \n",
      "Pleural effusion – Fluid may further develop within thin layers of tissue lining the lungs or pleura. This may call for a surgical treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What can you do to prevent pneumonia?\n",
      "The following are some of the effective measures of preventing pneumonia:\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstaining from smoking and alcohol\n",
      "Maintaining good hygiene to reduce chances of germ contact\n",
      "Early treatment of mild flu or influenza \n",
      "Eating healthy food to keep immune system at good state \n",
      "Taking very good care of new borns in terms of hygiene and protection from flu germs \n",
      "Maintaining clean and safe environment to reduce chances of people suffering from CAP - The most common type of pneumonia worldwide\n",
      "Vaccines against pneumonia. Prevnar is a pneumonia vaccine formulated for infants. Pneumovax is available for adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How often do elderly people above 65 years need to take pneumonia vaccines?\n",
      "A single dose of pneumonia is recommended for adults above 65 years. No annual vaccines are required. However, Pneumonia vaccines may perhaps not guarantee 100% prevention. However, people at high risk of pneumonia may definitely have a reduced chance of getting severe pneumonia in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can breastfeeding protect your child from pneumonia?\n",
      "The answer is YES. Breastfeeding gives your child every essential ingredients to strengthen the immune system and thus fight away germs. However, at a tender age, care needs to be taken that your baby is kept in a clean and safe environment; even if you are breastfeeding him/her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What food items can help to treat pneumonia?\n",
      "Apart from medical treatments discussed earlier (Refer Q.7), there are certain food items that can facilitate speedy recovery from pneumonia. However, you need to discuss with your doctor before making any drastic dietary change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Below listed are some of the food items that have shown to improve conditions in most patients:\n",
      "\n",
      "A mixed variety of fruits and vegetables you eat \n",
      "Beats and spinach are said to be very effective for pneumonia \n",
      "Carrot juice is also equally helpful \n",
      "Whole grains - Oats, brown rice, barley\n",
      "Cold water fish provide required amounts of protein and omega 3 fats \n",
      "Chicken soup is effective for all lung diseases including pneumonia \n",
      "6 – 10 cups of liquid, including water, juice, mild tea. Coffee needs to be avoided. Milk may lead to irritation in some patients and therefore you can choose according to your personal requirements\n",

      "What test does a doctor prescribe for Hyperkalemia and/or Hypokalemia?\n",
      "\n",
      "A doctor will order a potassium blood test to detect the amount of Potassium in body\n",
      "Besides, ECG/EKG can also be opted to determine heart beat patterns\n",
      "A kidney function test is also vital for potassium testing and vice versa. Kidneys play an important role in maintaining a sound balance of potassium within body. Therefore, abrupt potassium levels call for kidney function test and disturbed renal functions call for potassium tests. \n",
      "Diabetes also governs potassium levels in body. Therefore, testing for diabetes while experiencing potassium disorder symptoms is also beneficial.\n",
      "Finally, discussing symptoms with your doctor, accurately, is vital to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I go for Potassium tests?\n",
      "\n",
      "Potassium tests are available with multiple diagnostic centers across various cities in India. To know the best, affordable as well as nearest diagnostic center according to your location, you may visit here. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Exclude edibles that are rich in potassium. However, make sure that you are discussing it with your doctor before eliminating any vital food item from diet. \n",
      "Medicines may be prescribed that reduce potassium levels. Again, there are some other pharmaceutical drugs that increase levels of potassium. Therefore, discussing the same with your doctor and then deciding the steps to be followed is essential. \n",
      "Administering sodium bicarbonate \n",
      "Diurectics to increase kidney excretion and thus eliminating potassium from body \n",
      "Dialysis to improve renal functions that obstruct potassium balance in body. However, this is opted only when situations are severe and cannot be controlled by other methods. \n",
      "Extreme cases may call for intravenous therapy that triggers cell movement for external cell space to inside of cells. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options for Hypokalemia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Treating Hypokalemia is quite easy; as it involves inclusion of potassium rich food in your diet and certain potassium supplements. However, always make sure that you are taking supplements only after discussing with doctors. Prolonged use of potassium can have other side effects. To name one is Hyperkalemia. \n",
      "\n",
      "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can be taken under doctor's advice. These help in reducing renal excretion of potassium. However, this can again lead to excess potassium in body and therefore continuous monitoring with doctor is essential.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Is surgical treatment important for Hypokalemia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not under general conditions. Surgical interventions are needed only when there is a major cause behind loss of potassium from body and medication fails to deliver required solutions. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "What is Hypopotassemia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hypopotassemia is nothing but an alternative name for Hypokalemia. Causes and treatments remain the same as discussed above. \n",
      "\n",
      "Are potassium disorders fatal?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. potassium disorders (Hyperkalemia/Hypokalemia) are not life threatening. Diagnosing and treatments are available easily. However, if individuals are neglecting early symptoms, and are not opting for diagnostic procedures, low or high potassium levels can lead to other serious health disorders and may even get fatal. Out of the two, Hyperkalemia is a more serious health concern. \n",
      "\n",
      "How are atrial flutter and Hyperkalemia related?\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, Hyperkalemia is a relatively more severe condition as compared to low potassium levels. It is because, excess potassium in body may lead to an emergency condition known as Atrial flutter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Atrial or heart flutter is a condition of arrhythmia where the upper part of organ beats faster than lower chambers of heart. This condition where the heart has a severe abnormal heart rate may prove fatal; if proper and accurate remedial measures are not taken immediately. \n",

      "Following are few of the symptoms that help you know if you are pregnant. If you or anybody else is experiencing any of these symptoms, opting for a pregnancy test is recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early signs of pregnancy are:\n",
      "\n",
      "An absent period:\n",
      "\n",
      "You have skipped one or two of your monthly periods and have been sexually active for the past few months can suggest conception. However this can be a little confusing as irregular menstrual cycles may even be a result of other ovarian issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling similar to beginning of your cycles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every women, each month experiences few subtle symptoms that tell her she is about to start with her periods shortly. Many women experience similar symptoms when they conceive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spotting:\n",
      "\n",
      "Just after 10 days of conception, few women observe light period or what is known as spotting. In this case, women experience scanty bleeding which is lighter in color as compared to normal conditions. Spotting is due to implantation of the fertilized egg with uterus, and is known as implantation bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequent Urination:\n",
      "\n",
      "Women throughout pregnancy, feel an increased need of urination. However, frequent urge of urination may be indicative of other health disorders as well. So, visiting a doctor is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensitive breasts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pregnancy results in hormonal variations that may make your breasts feel a little tender for the first few weeks. Hormonal changes also bring about unusual emotional stress and mood swings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nausea:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Abrupt changes in food choices and habits:\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost 80 percent of women suddenly start disliking food items they usually like, during pregnancy. Mostly these food stuffs never remain a matter of concern after the end of pregnancy span. Again, many women develop extreme weakness for other edibles such as tamarind. Sometimes, apart from food choices, odor preferences are also witnessed. Many women also find themselves craving for some food items and feeling hungry more than usual.\n",
      "\n",

      "Can I get my periods even when I am pregnant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many women say that they have experienced some form of irregular and short period while they have already conceived. However, this is not something technically known as menstrual flow. This spotting that many women experience; mostly during early pregnancy, is a result of number of underlying aspects we remain unaware.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common reason is Implantation bleeding or spotting as explained above. Cervical or Vaginal bleeding after indulging in sex while pregnant can lead to mild spotting. Besides, hormones can also be a causative behind bleeding that is thought to be a cycle that is slightly irregular. However, if you are experiencing heavy periods when confirmed to be pregnant, visit a gynecologist immediately.\n",

However, the above mentioned table gives you a rough idea about the healthy sodium content you must have. To get the exact amount of salt, multiply the amount of sodium with 2.5 to get salt content. \n",
      "\n",
      "Who are at high risk of suffering from sodium disorders?\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients who are already suffering from the following diseases remain more susceptible to sodium disorders: \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the health hazards associated with excess sodium? \n",
      "\n",
      "Sodium in excess is medically termed as Hypernatremia. This condition  can lead to serious disorders in body. Topping the list are: \n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiac problems: Excess of sodium requires the body to hold back more water to dissolve extra sodium. This results in more blood and water in body. Additional volume of blood and fluid requires  human heart to perform more than usual and sets extra pressure on blood vessels. This is known as high blood pressure. Prolonged escalated levels of blood pressure make people susceptible to strokes, heart attacks and death.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Kidney troubles: Excess salt can also damage your kidneys. Some patients have severe renal issues even when they do not show any form of cardiac or blood pressure elevations.  \n",

      "Deadly cancer: Sodium in elevated levels can even lead to stomach ulcers and cancer. So beware and keep a check on your daily sodium intake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoporosis: Too much sodium; especially, table salt  may lead to frequent urination and thus loss of calcium. As the body looses calcium that is vital for bone health, your bones become weak and fragile. If no proper treatment or precautions are adopted, individuals become very susceptible to osteoporosis. You may learn about Osteoporosis here. \n",
      "\n",
      "What happens when you are deficient in sodium?\n",

      "\n",
      "Liver, cardiac and kidney problems lead to excess accumulation of water in body and thus causes sodium levels to fall below healthy levels \n",
      "Excess levels of ADH (antidiuretic hormone) leads to decreased urination and thus excess water in body. This again causes sodium to dilute more than usual and thus lowers the level.\n",
      "Severe vomiting and diarrhea leads to dehydration and thus not enough water is present to dilute sodium that is taken in through diet.\n",
      "Addison's disease tends to impair sodium balance by affecting hormonal cycle of adrenal glands\n",

      "Blood tests are also conducted to know further details\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options for Hyponatremia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosing hyponatremia involves blood test and urine test\n",
      "As hyponatremia is related to excess water, you may be suggested to reduce water intake by small volumes\n",
      "Besides, an intravenous fluid that compensates for low sodium can also be adopted\n",
      "Medications are usually prescribed to reduce severity of symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "Do athletes need to take extra precaution to maintain healthy sodium balance in body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Sodium balance is very important to keep your body energized.  As athletes loose a lot of water and sodium in the form of sweat, drinking water and eating salty food is vital. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is testing for sodium disorders too costly?\n",
      "\n",
      "NO. Sodium disorders can easily be detected through simple laboratory tests as mentioned above. Every clinic or diagnostic center offers sodium testing as mandatory service. You can get a detailed idea about the number of clinics along with their prices across various cities in India. (here) \n",
      "\n",
      "How is sodium related to potassium?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both sodium and potassium electrolytes are correlated and have opposite roles to play in the body. Sodium potassium balance is vital for healthy functioning of body. Excess of sodium can be controlled with potassium balance. Potassium causes removal of excess sodium through urination. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, potassium intake does not allow you to take sodium in excess. Excess potassium may lead to further disorders and therefore a balance is what we need to aim for. \n",
      "\n",
      "What is the ideal sodium to potassium ratio?\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal sodium potassium ration needs to be between 1:2 or 1:3. Bananas serve as a good source of potassium and sodium. \n",
      "\n",
      "Does sea salt have less sodium content?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people believe that sea salt has less sodium. However, this is not very true and therefore, taking in too much sodium through sea salt can prove detrimental equally.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is transient Ischemic attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) is a temporary stroke caused because of transient (temporary ) blockage in the blood vessels\n",
      "Some of the clots dissolve on their own while some don't. Scientists don't know the precise reason behind this. Generally, clots that exist for longer period of time, do not dissolve easily.\n",
      "It is commonly referred as mini stroke\n",
      "Average time period of TIA is one minute, while some of them last for over three-five minutes\n",
      "This stroke serves as warning and one must take it very seriously\n",
      "TIA does not cause permanent injury to the brain\n",
      "\n",
      "What is hemorrhagic stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when weak blood vessel ruptures\n",
      "This causes blood to leak in surrounding areas and compresses other blood vessels and tissues\n",
      "Aneurysm is a condition in which weakened part of the blood vessel is swollen or ballooned. If it is left untreated, it can get weaker and ultimately burst out causing bleeding in brain.\n",
      "Cluster of abnormally developed blood vessels leads to the condition of Arteriovenous malformation. Any of these blood vessels can burst causing bleeding in the brain.\n",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes are of two types- Intra-cerebral and sub-arachnoid hemorrhage\n",
      "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening type of stroke caused by bleeding of brain tissue\n",
      "Sub-arachnoid condition occurs in fetus and may cause miscarriage depending upon mother's age and fetus' gestation age\n",
      "\n",
      "What is atherosclerosis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Arteries are blood vessels that supply oxygenated blood from heart to different parts of body\n",
      "Arteries further divide into capillaries that reach out to each and every cell of the bodyHere, nutrients and oxygen from the blood are supplied to the cell and waste materials from the cell are exchanged into the blood.\n",
      "Blood now becomes impure and de-oxygenated\n",
      "Capillaries join together to form vein-lets and vein-lets combine further into veins\n",
      "Veins carry de-oxygenated blood or blood that is deprived of oxygen from different parts of the body to the heart for purification\n",
      "When plaque builds up in the arteries, it interrupts blood flow to organs. This condition is called atherosclerosis. Plaque consists of cholesterol, fats, calcium and other substances found in blood.\n",
      "Atherosclerosis can result in stroke and other fatal disorders\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "If any of the symptoms mentioned below are consistent for even short period of time, it is best to consult with doctor for diagnosis. Some common symptoms of stroke are enlisted here:\n",
      "\n",
      "Severe headache along with vomiting or altered consciousness\n",
      "Vision trouble\n",
      "Difficulty in speaking and understanding\n",

      "\n",
      "How is Ischemic stroke diagnosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ischemic stroke can be diagnosed by using various techniques such as CT Scan, MRI etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "CT scan: X-ray pictures of skull and brain are taken using Computed Tomography (CT) Scan machine. Patient is made to lie on a table that slides down into a tunnel-like device. The inside of this machine rotates and takes several X-ray pictures of brain from different angles. This enables the doctor to detect the presence blockages or clot inside the brain.\n",
      "MRI Scan: Unlike CT Scan, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technique does not use X-rays for imaging purposes. It makes use of radio waves and magnetic field to get accurate pictures of brain anatomy. It is highly effective in taking soft issue images and can show minute differences between similar areas. Patient is made to lie on a table and slided into the opening of MRI machine. The images assist doctors in identifying clots, blockages and tumors.\n",
      "Cerebral Angiogram: A thin, flexible tube called as catheter is inserted into groin through a small incision. It is further glided up to vertebral artery. A dye is injected into blood vessels for better view of arteries under X-ray imaging.\n",
      "Carotid Ultrasound: Carotid ultrasound test helps in identifying plaque build up and flow of blood in carotid arteries. It uses sound waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors may ask to do either single test or combination of tests for better analysis and interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Transient Ischemic Attack?\n",
      "\n",
      "Transient Ischemic Attack lasts for a very short duration and symptoms generally vanish within an hour. Symptoms of Transient Ischemic Attack are enlisted here:\n",
      "\n",
      "Facial paralysis or feeling of numbness in one side of body\n",
      "Double vision or loss of vision in either of the eyes\n",
      "Dizziness\n",
      "Loss of concentration and co-ordination\n",
      "Difficulty in speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "How is Transient Ischemic Attack diagnosed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) is a short-lived stroke, doctors generally diagnose it by asking more about the event, family history, rather than neurological examination. However, some doctors may recommend you to undergo certain tests like CT Scan, MRI Scan etc. (Refer Question 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Hemorrhagic stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemorrhagic stroke is a type of stroke in which blood vessel ruptures. This causes blood to leak in the organ, thereby compressing other blood vessels and affecting blood pressure. Since it can be a fatal kind of stroke, symptoms or early signs should be taken seriously and must not be ignored. Few symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke are enlisted here:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudden and severe headache\n",

      "Numb feeling on one side of body\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the diagnostic tests for hemorrhagic stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemorrhagic stroke is caused due to rupture of blood vessel in brain. It also includes some common tests like MRI Scan, CT Scan etc. However, doctors may suggest some other diagnostic tests to detect hemorrhagic stroke. (Refer question number 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Is stroke genetic?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many studies have revealed that people with family history of stroke, are at higher chances of suffering from brain stroke. This applies not only to stroke, but also to other diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer etc. So if you suffer from any of symptoms of stroke, you must not delay your appointment with doctor. It is always better to get diagnosed by doctor early, than to regret later.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the causes of stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Stroke occurs when supply of blood (oxygen supply) is restricted or when a weak blood vessel tears out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifestyle, genetics and other factors have influence on our overall well-being and health. Alterations in healthy lifestyle may increase chances of stroke.\n",
      "People who live sedentary lifestyle may also suffer stroke\n",
      "Alcohol and smoking are two demons that gradually kill you. Over consumption of alcohol has hazardous effect on bloodstream. People have reportedly been told to quit smoking as it poses serious threat to health. It not only sows a seed of stroke, but also a bunch of other diseases.\n",
      "High blood pressure is another cause of stroke. As the name suggests, more pressure is build up against walls of blood vessels that make weak blood vessel to rupture. This causes hemorrhage.\n",
      "Obesity leads to accumulation of fat deposits in blood stream that can block passages of blood vessels.\n",
      "Diabetes\n",
      "Genes too can be blamed for stroke. If any of your family member or close relative has had history of stroke, then you might as well suffer from stroke. So take precautions from beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are most likely to have stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain factors attributed to risk of stroke. The more risk factors you develop or are living with, more are the chances of stroke. Let us study what factors make you prone to stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetics: If any of your family member or close relative has suffered from stroke, then your chances of developing stroke are also increased.\n",
      "High Blood Pressure: People suffering from high blood pressure are at risk of developing stroke. High blood pressure can cause rupture of weak blood vessels that results in condition of hemorrhage. High blood pressure when left untreated may also lead to paralysis. Hence, high blood pressure patients must never ever miss any medication prescribed by their doctor.\n",
      "Smoking: Smoking is one of the leading causes of brain stroke. This habit damages blood vessels and increases blood pressure. Smoking also prohibits oxygen delivery to cells. Lungs of people who smoke are blackish-brown in color due to accumulation of toxic chemicals in it. As a result, lungs are not able to carry out their function with ease.\n",
      "Gender: Women, especially who take birth control pills, are more likely to suffer from stroke. At younger ages, men are more prone to suffer from stroke.\n",
      "Age: Older one gets, higher are chances of brain stroke.\n",
      "Ethnicity and race: African-American, native Alaskan people and American-Indian people are more likely to be diagnosed for stroke.\n",
      "Diabetes\n",
      "Alcohol and drug use is another major cause of brain stroke\n",
      "Depression\n",
      "Obese individuals\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatments for stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment for stroke depends on what kind of stroke you suffered from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aspirin: Aspirin is given as immediate treatment right after stroke to prevent occurrence of another stroke. It also prevents formation of blood clots and helps in thinning of blood.\n",
      "TPA: Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA), also called as alteplase, is administered into body in the form of injection via vein in the arm. It must be injected within four and half hours of stroke symptoms. TPA dissolves clot formations, thereby regulating blood flow. It also helps the patient to recover completely post stroke.\n",
      "Mechanical clot removal: A tiny mechanical device such as catheter (long, thin tube) is used to break up or remove the clot from brain. It is inserted through a small incision made across an artery in groin region to deliver Tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) directly into the area where stroke had occurred. TPA then melts the clot to clear blockage allowing blood to flow easily.\n",
      "Carotid endarterectomy: Carotid endarterectomy procedure is effective in reducing Ischemic stroke. Plaque from carotid arteries (arteries that are found on both side of the neck that connect with brain) is removed through this surgical procedure. A small incision is made on front of neck that gives access to carotid arteries. A surgeon then opens up these arteries and removes plaque from it. Artery is then repaired by stitches comprised of a vein section or graft (artificial material). Carotid endarterectomy procedure may not suit people suffering from heart disease or other medical conditions.\n",
      "Surgical blood vessel repair: Ruptured blood vessels as in case of hemorrhage are treated by surgical blood vessel repair procedure. Various surgical procedures such as surgical clipping, intracranial bypass, stereotactic radiosurgery, coiling etc. are implemented to treat ruptured blood vessels.\n",
      "Surgical clipping: A small clamp is placed at the base of aneurysm. Aneurysm is excessive enlargement of artery caused because of weakness in arterial walls. This small clamp prevents flow of blood to aneurysm, thereby preventing it from bursting. It also prevents re-bleeding of aneurysm that has previously been operated upon.\n",
      "Intracranial bypass: Surgical bypass of intracranial blood vessels (blood vessels of brain) is an option to treat poor blood flow to certain region of brain or complex vascular lesions.\n",
      "Stereotactic radiosurgery: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive treatment that implements use of highly focused radiation to treat vascular malformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are stroke recovery solutions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Post stroke treatment, doctor will advise you to go for rehabilitation program. You will be required to stay in the hospital for few days to recover and heal. Rehabilitation treatment counts upon the type of stroke and its intensity. Different types of strokes have different type of rehabilitation procedures. If the stroke has occurred in right side of the brain, your left side gets affected causing speech and language problems. If stroke has harmed left side of brain tissues, movement and sensation on right side of body might get affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "What precautions should I take to avoid stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Practicing healthy habits right from early age can go a long way to avoid stroke. Some of the precautionary measures that you can follow to reduce the risk of stroke are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Eat healthy foods. Incorporate thermogenic or fat burning foods in your diet. Thermogenic foods such as egg whites, chicken, turkey, legumes and beans etc., harness more energy to effectively digest it. As a result, more calories are burned.\n",
      "Exercise should be on your priority list. It will help burn fat and maintain your body-mass index.\n",
      "Get regular health check-ups done\n",
      "Check medical history of your family\n",
      "Quit smoking and keep a check on alcohol consumption\n",
      "Do mental exercises. Mental health is as important as physical health. Try some memory games and keep yourself active. Learning a new language or musical instrument will help as well.\n",
      "If in depression, do not hesitate or feel uncomfortable to consult a psychologist. Talk to your family and friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "What lifestyle changes can I make to avoid brain stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Adopting a healthy lifestyle not only decreases your chances of stroke, but also increases your longevity by keeping you fit and healthy. Here are some lifestyle changes recommendations that will help in keeping stroke at bay:\n",
      "\n",
      "Quit smoking. Yes, you need to quit smoking as it increases stroke chances by two folds. Smoking is anyway not good for your health. It is one of the leading causes of liver cancer. Even passive smoking is hazardous for health.\n",
      "Being physically active decreases fat percentage in body, thereby restricting cholesterol deposits in lining of blood vessels. Exercise improves blood circulation and ensures proper blood flow to organs of body.\n",
      "Seek emotional support whenever necessary. Consult a physiologist to reduce burden of emotional pain. Give attention to your mental health.\n",
      "Reduce stress levels. Life is too beautiful to succumb to pressure and stress levels. Have a feeling of gratitude. Positivity heals stress and releases feel-good hormones.\n",
      "Limit intake of trans fatty acids found in fast foods such as burger, pizza, refined flour or maida, bakery items, fried items etc. Trans fatty acids are hazardous to our health as they increase cholesterol amount in body.\n",
      "Restrict use of salt. Over-consumption of salt can cause high blood pressure, thereby increasing chances of stroke.\n",
      "Take medicines as directed by your physician. If you miss on them, it becomes more complicated to treat stroke.\n",
      "Maintain healthy weight. Your weight should be in proportion to your height.\n",
      "Regular medical check-ups are advised. Early detection will reduce further complications.\n",
      "Blood pressure should be checked on regular basis\n",
      "Eat healthy diet comprising of green leafy vegetables and fruits. Limit intake of red meats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which exercises should I do to avoid stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies have shown that exercises are your best mate to avoid stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardio and aerobic exercises that make you breathe heavy and sweat profoundly are especially more effective to prevent occurrence of stroke. Exercise cuts down fat deposits in body, thereby avoiding atherosclerosis disorder.\n",
      "Doing yoga on regular basis not only reduces stress, but also chances of stroke. Asanas (yoga positions) like halasana (shoulder stand), shirshasan (head stand) etc., increase the supply of blood to brain by giving brain tissues a good exercise. Please note that it is always better to perform these asanas under guidance of a yoga teacher or practitioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which exercises to practice post stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Importance of exercise post stroke should not be under-estimated. Of-course you are not expected to put on your running shoes and start high cardio activity immediately after stroke. It is better to start slowly and eventually increase cardio strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can try any cardio activities such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming etc. Walking slowly for at least half an hour everyday in the initial period is more than enough. Please do consult your doctor before you start any cardio exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "What diet plan should I follow to reduce risk of stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Diet plays an indispensable role in maintaining overall health. It is recommended to consume balanced diet of whole grains, dals and legumes, fish, low-fat dairy products, fruits and vegetables. Eat at least four to five servings of fruits everyday.\n",
      "\n",
      "What diet plan should I follow post stroke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Diet goes a long way in keeping body fit and healthy. Here are some tips for stroke patients to follow. Ask your doctor about diet consultation for enhanced benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some stroke patients may experience loss of appetite. For such patients, it is recommended to add more flavors and spices in order to increase palatability quotient of food.\n",
      "Choose colorful foods such as carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, green leafy vegetables, salmon etc. to make food appear visually appealing\n",
      "Choose foods that are easy and soft to chew\n",
      "Consume diet rich in fruits and vegetables\n",
      "Increase protein rich foods in your diet. Post surgery, there is loss of muscle and tissue. To replenish this loss, it is important to consume protein rich foods like eggs etc.\n",
      "Limit intake of alcohol\n",
      "Eat fiber-rich Foods\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the costs of stroke treatment procedures in India?\n",

      "\n",
      "What is Swine Flu?\n",
      "\n",
      "Swine is a synonym of pig and Swine Flu means influenza in pigs. Influenza viruses that cause severe respiratory diseases in pigs can get transmitted to other pigs and even humans; resulting in severe health disorders. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first case of Swine flu in humans was recorded in the year 2009 in Mexico. Thereafter, there has been an increase in Swine flu cases all over the world; including India.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is H1N1 virus and H3N2 influenza virus?\n",
      "H1N1 virus is a subtype of the influenza A virus and is a common cause of influenza in humans. H1N1 is a combination of glycoproteins known as haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Depending upon the number of H and N it contains, the same virus is named as H1N2 or H1N2 and so on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Few strains of H1N1 virus cause normal seasonal influenza in humans. However there are specific Strains of H1N1 virus, that have been known to cause influenza in pigs. These can further  mutate and enter the human body. Other H1N1 strains cause flu in birds and this is known as avian influenza. \n",
      "\n",
      "H3N2v has been determined recently to cause swine flu as compared to H1N1. The “v” stands for variant that means the virus was earlier common to pigs alone but has now invaded the human anatomy as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the common Symptoms of Swine Flu?\n",
      "Symptoms of swine flu are not very different from usual influenza symptoms. However, not opting for early diagnosis and treatment may prove fatal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Below listed are few of the common symptoms of Swine flu:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some patients may experience fever. However, many don't show high body temperature even when infected by the virus. \n",
      "Dry Cough and sore throat \n",
      "Headache and extreme fatigue \n",
      "Body pain \n",
      "Diarrhea and vomiting \n",
      "Nausea \n",
      "Running nose or some people may even suffer from blocked nose \n",
      "Red and watery eyes \n",
      "Severe cases may show breathing troubles. People already suffering from asthma, mostly show this symptom. \n",
      "Swine flu may even lead to Pneumonia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are at the highest risk of getting Swine flu? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Infants below age 6 months are very prone to this virus. However, teenagers are also susceptible to a great extent. \n",
      "Pregnant women \n",
      "Elderly people above the age of 50 years or so \n",
      "People already suffering from lung disorders such as Asthma, Pneumonia etc. \n",
      "People who regularly eat pork that is not well cooked, or remain in close association with pigs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What tests will your doctor order to detect swine flu?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors usually discuss symptoms and your probable chances of exposure to virus. Thereafter, a quick nasopharyngeal swab test is ordered to check for influenza A and B virus. Presence of Influenza B virus does not prove Swine flu, while Influenza A confirms Swine flu. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, many diagnostic centers now offer specific swine flu test, a combination of tests that are helpful in swine flu detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Swine Flu contagious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Swine Flu is extensively contagious. It can get transmitted from an infected person through droplets released during sneezing or coughing. Clothes, tissues or anything else that may contain the virus can affect a healthy person who comes in contact with these items. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, people infected with the disease need to be kept isolated for preventing spread of the virus. It must be noted that eating well cooked pork cannot transmit the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For how long thus swine flu remain contagious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Swine flu is highly contagious just one day prior to visible symptoms that make a person sufficiently ill. For five to seven days, the disease remains contagious; however, the period may even last to 14 days or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the isolation period of swine flu?\n",
      "\n",
      "As evident, isolation period depends on the span during which the disease remains contagious. Therefore, on an average, the isolation period lasts for 4 days to 14 days or so. Your doctor will be the best person to decide your incubation period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options for Swine Flu?\n",
      "\n",
      "Swine Flu can be treated with vaccines. Today, different vaccines that are suitable for people belonging to different age groups, infants and pregnant women, are available. Hospitalization is usually advisable to reduce chances of spread and also facilitates continuous monitoring of patients. Drugs or medications are not very effective as the virus gains resistance to these drugs after few days of administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the recovery period of Swine Flu?\n",
      "Swine flu recovery period absolutely depends upon your immune system and how severe the symptoms are. Approximately, a span of 14 days or so needs to be taken as a minimum recovery period of swine flu. However, people are seen spending a month under treatment as their body shows slower response to treatment processes. \n",
      "\n",
      "People suffering from other lung disorders tend to complicate the disease and therefor require more time to recover from the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What should I eat while recovering from Swine flu?\n",
      "\n",
      "Healthy diet is a key to pace your recovery from any disease. Here's what you need to eat during Swine flu:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hydration is mandatory. Water and juices need to be taken in ample amount \n",
      "Swine flu depends upon your immune system. Proteins, Vitamin C and Zinc are said to strengthen immune system. Therefore, taking food rich in these is substantial to your cure. \n",
      "Swine flu leads to a really bad sore throat. Therefore, curbing food items such as dairy products and those which are sour in taste, can prove beneficial. Instead, drinking water mixed with honey or ground cloves can relieve discomfort to a great extent. \n",
      "Getting enough of Vitamin D is also recommended \n",

      "Can Swine flu be prevented?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, swine flu can definitely be prevented. Following are some of the easy to take steps against swine flu:\n",
      "\n",
      "Covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing. A basic hygiene that does a lot to stop the disease from spreading. \n",
      "Washing your hands is again essential. Viruses are spread through hands that either carry them to mouth or nose when we inhale them. Therefore, washing hands before eating or after sneezing/coughing, after you have returned home etc. is important. \n",
      "Learning more about the flu and discussing vaccines with doctors can also help you to prevent the disease\n",
      "Avoiding unhygienic food \n",
      "Washing fruits and vegetables before intake. Boiling water and taking purifying steps is recommended \n",
      "If you are taking care of any person infected with the swine flu virus, talk to your doctor about safety measures you need to follow\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can vaccines guarantee complete prevention?\n",
      "\n",
      "NO. Vaccines do not mean that you will never get the disease. And this again does not mean that you will not opt for vaccines. H1N1 vaccines are 90% effective. And even if you get the disease after shots, you can be assured of an easy recovery and negligible complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I eat pork?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, provided it is well cooked under hygienic conditions. Eating pork does not transmit the disease as wrongly thought by many people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Are face masks helpful to keep you safe from swine flu?\n",
      "Wearing a mask and skipping all other preventive measures cannot guarantee swine flu protection. Yes, putting on a mask can definitely be a careful step to fight the virus, but it cannot guarantee complete prevention.\n",

      "What is Syphilis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD), caused by a virus named Treponema pallidum which is highly contagious\n",
      "It is spread through sexual contact, that is, vaginal, anal or oral sex\n",
      "It can lead to complications if left untreated for a long time and cause damage to vital organs like the heart and the brain\n",
      "Diagnosis of this disease is also very challenging\n",
      "However, if detected in its early stages, it is very simple to cure with correct treatment\n",
      "Infected people are often unaware of their disease and pass it on to their partner\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different stages of Syphilis?\n",
      "There are four stages in Syphilis. In the first two stages, syphilis is very infectious. In the latent stage, it is still active but has no visible symptoms. It is not contagious at this stage. The tertiary stage is the most destructive health-wise.\n",
      "These are explained below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary Stage\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary stage starts three or four weeks after the patient has been infected with bacteria\n",
      "The infection starts with a small, round sore called as chancre\n",
      "The patient might notice a single sore, but in fact there will be multiple sores\n",
      "The chancre is the location where the syphilis enters the body. It is painless but highly infectious and the sore may be in the mouth, genitals or rectum\n",
      "Syphilis is transmitted by direct contact with a sore. This usually happens during sexual activity, including oral sex.\n",
      "The sore lasts for three to six weeks and then heals; irrespective of whether the infected person has received treatment\n",
      "Even after the sore has healed, the person must receive treatment so that the disease does not move to the second stage\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary Stage\n",
      "\n",
      "The infected person may suffer from skin rashes and sore throat\n",
      "The rash does not itch and is usually found on palms of the hand and soles of the feet. However, it is not always restricted to these two areas on the body.\n",
      "The rash looks like rough, reddish-brown spots\n",
      "The rash will be accompanied by other symptoms.\n",
      "The symptoms recede even if treatment is not received. Still the person must receive medication, otherwise he'll still be infected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Latent Stage\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a hidden or dormant stage\n",
      "The symptoms from the first two stages disappear and there will be no noticeable indications for syphilis. But the infection will still be present.\n",
      "The secondary symptoms may reappear or this stage might continue like this for ten to thirty years\n",
      "Then, finally the disease enters its last stage\n",
      "\n",
      "Tertiary Stage\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately 15 to 30% of people who have not received treatment will progress to this final stage\n",
      "The Tertiary Stage may occur decades after the initial infection\n",
      "At this stage, the disease affects the major organs and can be potentially fatal\n",
      "The outcomes of this stage can be:\n",
      "   \n",
      "Blindness\n",
      "Deafness\n",
      "Dementia \n",
      "Memory loss\n",

      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are the people at risk of infection?\n",
      "The symptoms of the primary and secondary stages can often go undetected and also  can often be confused with some other ailment. Therefore it is best for people at risk to undergo tests to diagnose syphilis. The people at risk are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who have had unprotected sex with a person who might have been infected\n",
      "Pregnant women\n",
      "Sex workers\n",
      "People in prison\n",
      "People who have had unprotected sex with multiple partners\n",
      "Those who have partners, who have had unprotected sex with multiple people\n",
      "Men who have sex with men\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the common signs and symptoms for this disease?\n",
      "The symptoms are different for various stages.\n",
      "Symptoms for Primary stage\n",
      "\n",
      "One or more painless ulcers in and around the genitals and mouth, within three weeks of exposure to the bacteria\n",
      "In men, the chancre (Check question 2) occurs frequently in the genital area, usually (but not always) on the penis\n",
      "In women, the chancre develops on the outer genitals or in the inner part of the vagina. If it is present inside the vagina or at its opening(called as cervix) then it can barely be noticed\n",
      "Lymph nodes might swell around the region of the chancre\n",
      "The sores might develop in other parts of the body\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms for Secondary stage\n",
      "\n",
      "A noticeable rash appears 2 to 12 weeks after the appearance of sores\n",
      "They are reddish-brown in colour, solid, flat or raised and 2 cm across. In darker skinned people, the rash is lighter in colour than the surrounding skin. But these rashes can be mistaken for some other common skin disease.\n",
      "Small, pus-filled sores might occur on the mucous membrane. Otherwise, moist sores called  condyloma lata might be present. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different tests suggested to diagnose syphilis?\n",
      "Tests used for screening are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) Test: Checks blood and spinal fluid for presence of antibodies created in response to the cells \tdamaged by bacteria. This antibody produced is not unique for only syphilis. So the test is not always accurate.\n",
      "Rapid Plasma Reagin Test (RPR Test): This test also checks the blood for antibodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tests used for confirming syphilis are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) Test: It is a blood test which checks for syphilis antibodies. A positive test must be further confirmed with a VDRL or RPR test.\n",
      "Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS) Test: This too checks for antibodies. The test is performed on a sample of blood or spinal fluid. \tSyphilis can be easily detected; except for the first three or four weeks after infection.\n",
      "Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination Assay (TPPA): Tests for antibodies of syphilis in the blood. It is not performed on spinal fluid. This test is performed only after another test is found to be positive.\n",
      "Darkfield Microscopy: The test is mainly used for detection in early stages. A sample fluid or tissue from a sore is taken and observed under a special microscope.\n",
      "Microhemagglutination assay (MHA-TP): This is another test used to confirm the infection, after other tests have tested positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the different Treatment Methods for Syphilis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary and Secondary Syphilis is easily treated with a penicillin injection\n",
      "Penicillin is a widely used antibiotic and is successful in curing this disease\n",
      "Some people who are allergic to penicillin, are given oral antibiotic like ceftriaxone and doxycycline \n",
      "Patients suffering from Neurosyphilis get a daily dose of intravenous penicillin. They are often required to be hospitalized for a short period of time.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the damage caused by this disease is irreversible\n",
      "The bacteria can be killed, but the treatment mainly focuses on alleviating pain and easing discomfort\n",
      "During treatment, all sexual contact is to be avoided until all the sores have healed and the doctor has confirmed that sexual activity can be resumed\n",
      "If the infected person is sexually active, then the partner should be treated too. Sexual activity should be suspended until the treatment of both partners is complete.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is tooth decay or dental caries?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dental caries takes place due to bacteria in the mouth, which eat away at the enamel of the tooth\n",
      "A cavity, or hole is formed at the place where the acid of the bacteria causes the enamel to wear away\n",
      "If not treated, tooth decay can cause pain, infection and tooth loss\n",
      "The tooth consists of three layers:\n",
      "    \n",
      " The enamel is the hard outer layer which does not contain any blood vessels or nerves. Due to this, the enamel is not sensitive to pain.\n",
      "The dentine is the middle layer and forms most part of the tooth. It is soft and forms a covering for the next layer, the pulp. Dentine is also very sensitive to pain.\n",
      "The center of the tooth is called as the pulp. It contains blood vessels and nerves and is considered to be the living part of the tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more layers that are affected by the bacteria, more is the damage\n",
      "Dental plaque is a thin, sticky film of bacteria that keeps forming over the teeth\n",
      "Food and drinks that contain more sugar or starch (such as milk, bread, cookies, sodas, juices etc.), help the bacteria to produce acid\n",

      "A white spot, the first sign of tooth decay, appears at the place where the enamel has been worn away\n",
      "Tooth decay can be stopped or reversed at this point\n",
      "\n",
      "Stage 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the decay is not stopped over a period of time, the enamel starts decaying below the surface with the upper surface still intact\n",

      "Stage 3:\n",
      "\n",

      "Eating sugary and starchy foods that feed the bacteria in the mouth\n",
      "The body is lacking fluoride. Fluoride makes the teeth more resistant to plaque and acid produced by bacteria.\n",
      "Not having enough saliva. Saliva helps to wash away food and protects the teeth. A dry mouth may be caused by\n",

      "\n",
      "Suffering from diabetes\n",
      "Smoking tobacco or breathing in second hand smoke\n",
      "Children are more likely to suffer from tooth decay than adults. The minerals in the teeth of children are new and so, they are not very strong. It is easier for the bacteria to eat away these minerals and cause cavities.\n",
      "Babies who are put to bed with a feeding bottle in their mouth suffer a high risk of infection. Tooth decay is caused by sugar in the milk, formula or juice. Though babies are not born with bacteria in their mouths, they can get them by sharing the same forks, spoons and utensils with adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the signs and symptoms of Tooth Decay?\n",
      "There is no symptom of tooth decay until a cavity has formed or the tooth has been infected. When this has happened, a person may suffer from:\n",
      "\n",
      "Toothache: A continuous pain or an occasional short, jabbing pain\n",
      "Tooth Sensitivity: Tenderness or pain while eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet\n",
      "Swelling in the gum near an infected tooth. This can be a sign of acute tooth decay or an abscessed tooth (pulp of the tooth is infected and a pocket of pus has formed next to it). \n",

      "\n",
      "What are the different tests suggested to diagnose tooth decay?\n",
      "When there is severe toothache, a dentist should be consulted. Even if the pain goes away, the tooth decay will keep growing and therefore treatment should be taken. If not, the cavity could worsen or the tooth may die. To diagnose the infection, the dentist:\n",

      "Asks questions about previous dental and medical problems and care\n",
      "Examines the mouth and the teeth with a small mirror\n",
      "Probes the teeth with dental instruments to look for soft areas\n",
      "X-ray tests are performed on the mouth and the teeth to see the extent of cavities and decay, which cannot be seen with the naked eye\n",
      "Applies a non-toxic dye on the teeth and then washes it away. The dye sticks to the decaying area and is washed clean from healthy teeth. This is a brand new technique for tooth decay diagnosis.\n",

      "Ice or cold packs against the outside of the cheeks for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, several times a day \n",
      "An over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be taken\n",
      "\n",
      "The treatment for tooth decay depends on how severe it is:\n",
      "\n",
      "For early stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "The dentist will talk to the patient about the amount of sugar in their diet or the frequency of their meals\n",
      "Then a fluoride gel or paste is applied to the infected area\n",
      "Fluoride helps to strengthen the enamel and protects the teeth by making them resistant to the acids from the plaque\n",
      "\n",
      "For  damaged enamel:\n",
      "\n",
      "If cavity has formed, a filling is done on the tooth. The dental decay is removed and a local anesthetic is used to numb the tooth and fill in the gap.\n",
      "If the damage is severe, the whole, or part of the tooth is replaced by a dental cap. It is a man-made substitute of a part of the tooth\n",
      "If the tooth decay has reached the pulp of the tooth, then root canal treatment is done. A root canal removes the diseased part. To know more about the pulp of the tooth, refer question 1  .\n",
      "Extraction of the tooth, if it is severely damaged. Replacement is done with the help of a denture, bridge or a dental implant.\n",

      "Taking good care of teeth by brushing twice a day using fluoride toothpaste, in the morning as well as at night. Teeth should also be flossed daily.\n",
      "Annual or biannual checkups at the dentist are essential, so that problems can be found before they get too serious\n",
      "Snacking before going to bed should be avoided as food left in the teeth overnight is more likely to cause cavities\n",
      "Staying away from food with lots of sugar like desserts, specially in-between meals and at least one hour before going to bed\n",
      "Avoiding smoking and alcohol, as tobacco inhibits saliva production and alcohol decays the enamel\n",
      "Fluoride supplements should be taken, after consulting a dentist \n",

      "What do you mean by Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ulcerative Colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disorder that affects the colon and rectum lining. The inflammation starts in the rectum, where small ulcers are formed, and then proceeds to the colon. In rarest of cases, Ulcerative Colitis may affect the small intestine beyond the lower most portion. However, the chances for this are very low or negligible. These ulcers are formed as colon cells die and lead to mucus and pus discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does Ulcerative Colitis affect colon?\n",
      "Ulcerative Colitis affects the bowel lining causing excessive damage and death of cells. This condition leads to the formation of ulcers. Formation of ulcers proceeds to bleeding, discharge of mucus and pus. The condition weakens the colon to an extent that the organ no longer is capable of continuing with its normal functioning, leading to frequent bowel movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "It is unfortunate that causes of Ulcerative Colitis are still unknown. Earlier, doctors and researchers suggested that stress, trauma and wrong diet were the probable reasons. However, lately they have confirmed that these factors only add up to the problem but don't generate the ailment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the most common assumption about the disease is that it is taken to be an autoimmune disorder (Explained in answer to next question). Again, there are few researchers who take genetic problems to be one possible reason. Researchers continue to drive out the exact cause leading to this health problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean by autoimmune disorder?\n",
      "Autoimmune disorder is a condition where your immune system functions wrongly and attacks cells of the body. Our immune system is required to identify reasons of threat and then generate antibodies to fight the possible foreign entity and eliminate chances of threat. \n",
      "\n",
      "However in some cases, as is thought about in Ulcerative Colitis, the body affects harmless and rather important bacteria within the colon lining, and thus results in colon inflammation. As explained above, inflammation results in death of cells and formation of ulcers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pain in the belly \n",
      "Rectum Bleeding \n",
      "Acute Diarrhea \n",
      "Some may even have problems of defecating despite the need \n",
      "Stool accompanied with blood \n",
      "Excessive weight loss\n",
      "\n",
      "As the disease progresses, it leads to following additional symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "Body pain\n",
      "Swelling around joints \n",
      "Dehydration\n",
      "Ulcer formation proceeds to other parts of skin \n",
      "Sores in the mouth \n",
      "Nausea and vomiting \n",
      "Eye troubles \n",
      "Liver diseases\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are at the greatest risk of suffering from Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ulcerative colitis may affect anybody belonging to any gender or age. However, doctors suggest that some remain at greater risk of suffering from the disease. These factors that make individuals more susceptible to the condition include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Age is a an essential aspect governing possibilities: \n",
      " \n",
      "Men and women below the age of 30 remain more susceptible to the disease\n",
      "Teenagers around 15 years have the highest chances of developing this disease\n",
      "However, patients above 30 can even develop the disease at some point of time\n",
      "Individuals above 60 years remain at the lowest possibility of suffering from the disease\n",
      " \n",
      "Patients who have someone suffering from the disease in family: As genetics is considered as one of the causative reasons behind the disease, people who have family history need to be more careful as they are likely to develop the same after some of time. Visiting a doctor and opting for health screening exams is suggested. \n",
      "\n",
      "Europeans are more susceptible than Asians: Race plays an important deciding factor. Europeons, Black and some Jewish communities remain at greater risk of developing the disease when compared to Asian population. However, this does not mean that Asians can never develop the ailment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medication such as Isotretinoin: Isotretinoin is effective in treating acne or cystic acnes. This medicine is assumed to increase the risk of developing Immune Bowel Disorders in some people. Therefore, use of this medicine is supposed to increase the risk factor of Ulcerative Colitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What tests does a doctor order for Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "Symptoms can very well determine the condition. However, doctors do order for number of diagnostic tests and exams for Ulcerative Colitis. Following are the common diagnosis procedures available for Ulcerative Colitis:\n",
      "\n",
      "A blood test to check for anemic conditions \n",
      "Stool Test to rule out gastroenteritis conditions, as these can also lead to similar symptoms as in Ulcerative Colitis \n",
      "\n",
      "Sigmoidoscopy: A procedure that involves insertion of a thin tube attached to a camera into your rectum. This allows your doctor to examine inside of your lower colon and rectum; thus, determining the exact condition. \n",
      "The procedure also enables a small collection of tissues from the area that can be sent to a laboratory for testing. This procedure is known as Biopsy. The entire procedure can take around 15 minutes and you will be given sedatives to remain relaxed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Colonoscopy: A similar procedure to sigmoidoscopy; however, this enables your doctor to examine every part of your colon and not just the lower section as in Sigmoidoscopy. The procedure is only opted when sigmoidoscopy results suggest that the infection could have spread to upper part of colon or the entire organ. The techniques also remain the same with the only difference being the type of tube used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the treatment options of Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ulcerative Colitis has two treatment options as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Early diagnosis of the ailment can be treated with medication\n",
      "Surgical removal of colon becomes necessary when the problem becomes severe\n",
      "\n",
      "Medication: Doctors suggest drugs that help to reduce inflammation and diarrhea. As frequent bowel movements result in dehydration, your doctor will try to treat this condition as well. Hospitalization may also be suggested if there is excessive loss of water from the body. Some times, medications to control immune system functions are also suggested.\n",
      "Surgical treatment: If there is excessive bleeding that cannot be controlled with medicines, Ulcerative Colitis needs a surgical cure. Colon may get surgically removed to reduce bleeding and eliminate chances of cancer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once the colon is removed, the doctor makes a small opening in the abdominal wall that connects to the lowest portion of small intestine. Waste from the small intestine moves through the opening and collects in a bag. The entire process is known as Proctocolectomy. \n",
      "\n",
      "If only a part of the colon is removed retaining the rectum, the procedure is known as Ileoanal \n",
      "anastomosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I prevent Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "As the causes are not yet confirmed, exact preventive measures cannot be suggested. However still, making changes in your diet and lowering stress can definitely help to prevent. Moreover, being more cautious if you are having a family history can help to take early actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the dietary recommendations for preventing or reducing discomforts during Ulcerative Colitis?\n",
      "\n",
      "Limit intake of milk products if lactose intolerant: People suffering from other Inflammation Bowel Disorders are seen to benefit from reduced dairy product intake. Therefore, if you are suffering from Ulcerative Colitis, you too can reduce the severity of symptoms by reducing milk and milk product intake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid fatty food: Lowering fatty food consumption can reduce diarrhea and thus ease your symptoms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limiting Fiber: Some people may develop problems due to high intake of fiber. Although fiber is good for your health; sometimes patients may suffer severity of symptoms due to high intake of fiber. \n",
      "\n",
      "Small and frequent meals: Eating small amounts in shorter intervals relaxes your digestive system and gives sufficient time to perform averagely well and remain close to normal. Always try to drink sufficient water. Intake of fluids is also beneficial as they are easily digested and thus does not over load your system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can dietary changes alone bring about complete cure?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. Diet cannot help to cure the disease. It is only medicines and surgery that can treat the condition. However, above dietary recommendations can help to ease out the severity of symptoms and deliver some relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can ulcerative colitis prove fatal?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not generally. The disease can be well controlled with medication and surgery. However, late diagnosis can result in additional health disorders and some of them can be fatal. Therefore, opting for timely diagnosis and treatment is something that is of utmost importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can ulcerative colitis lead to colon cancer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, if the entire colon is affected. On the other hand, if it is only your lower colon and rectum that are affected, you cannot be precisely considered to be a potential candidate to develop colon cancer. Your chances can be same as anyone else who is not suffering from the disease. Therefore, the doctor needs to conduct an early diagnosis to know how severe is your ulcer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Does ulcerative colitis interfere with normal pregnancy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Women suffering from the disease will mostly have normal pregnancies. However, if you suddenly experience a flare up in the symptoms during pregnancy, then you need to visit the doctor immediately. \n",
      "In addition, if you suddenly develop colitis symptoms during pregnancy, it is risky. You become more likely to give birth to premature babies.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the importance of Vitamin A in our bodies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin which naturally occurs in a lot of food items\n",
      "There are many forms of Vitamin A needed by the body. Like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Retinal: It is a substance which is required for rhodopsin formation and vision. Rhodopsin is a pigment found in rod cells of the retina and is extremely light sensitive.\n",
      "Retinol:\n",
      "\n",
      "Retinol along with its derivatives are essential for maintenance of the skin and mucosal cells\n",
      "It also serves as a barrier against infection\n",
      "Retinol is also required for white blood cell (WBC) development\n",
      "\n",
      "Retinoic acid: It is the main hormonal metabolite and is used for growth and differentiation of epithelial cells\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin A is important for:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vision:\n",
      "\n",
      "The eye needs to create certain pigments for the photoreceptor cells in the retina to work properly\n",
      "\n",
      "Retina is a tissue which is located at the back of the eye. Light reflected from objects, enters the eyes and gets reflected in the tissues.\n",
      "When light strikes the retina, retinol is converted to retinal and given to the rod cells\n",
      "Rod cells help in vision in the dark. Inside it, the retinal binds to a protein called as opsin\n",
      "The opsin changes its shape and a nerve impulse is triggered\n",
      "The nerve impulse travels to the brain and provides it information about the objects inside its visual field\n",
      "Retinal is again converted to retinol, completing the visual cycle\n",
      "\n",
      "To view the entire spectrum of light, the pigments in the photoreceptor cells are very essential\n",
      "Vitamin A also nourishes the cornea, a clear film in front of the eye. Without it, there would not be enough lubrication for the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regulation of Genes:\n",
      "\n",
      "The genes contain the code for vital proteins needed by the body. The proteins are required for the body to carry out its daily functions.\n",
      "When the proteins are needed, the genetic code is transcribed (synthesis of genetic code by copying from existing DNA)\n",
      "Genetic transcription is closely monitored. The retinoic acid in Vitamin A controls when genes are transcribed and how fast it is done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support of the Immune System:\n",
      "\n",
      "The retinol in the Vitamin A is used for maintaining cells of the skin and the lining of the digestive, urinary and respiratory tracts\n",
      "These cells form a key part of the immune system\n",
      "The cells form the first line of defense against infection\n",
      "Vitamin A is also used to form white blood cells\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Blood Cell Production:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin A helps in the production of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by stem cells\n",

      "What are the different treatment methods suggested for Vitamin D deficiency?\n",
      "The various treatment methods used for treatment of Vitamin D deficiency are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the deficiency is in mild or moderate form, then simple lifestyle changes that include eating Vitamin D rich foods and getting more sunlight are recommended\n",
      "For some patients, doctors may also advice an intake of supplements for Vitamin D\n",
      "When cases are severe and patients have been affected by factors such as bone density and growth, injections for Vitamin D are suggested\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Which foods are recommended for getting Vitamin D in right proportion?\n",
      "Though it is true that food alone cannot help getting proportionate Vitamin D, some food sources that can help are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fish that are rich in oil, such as mackerel, sardines and salmon\n",
      "Fat spreads that are fortified\n",
      "Powdered milk\n",

      "Breakfast cereals that are fortified\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Infants fed exclusively with breastfeeding need supplement of Vitamin D – Right or Wrong?\n",
      "Firstly it needs to be understood that breastfeeding is a necessity for six months from birth of the baby and is the right food form for growth and development of the infant. Breast milk provides essential immunological agents and nutrients for developing the immune system of babies.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, breast milk is not a rich source for providing Vitamin D. This is especially true for breastfeeding mothers who themselves are deficient in Vitamin D. This is the reason why supplements of Vitamin D are prescribed for infants fed exclusively with breast milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does a vegan diet lead to deficiency of Vitamin D?\n",
      "It is a fact that any individual; irrespective of whether he or she is vegan or a non-vegetarian, will develop a deficiency for Vitamin D if right sources of Vitamin D are not included in diet or if exposure to sun is not sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies prove that a vegan diet provides lesser intake of Vitamin D in comparison to that provided to meat-eaters or lacto-ovo vegetarians (people who consume eggs and milk products).\n",

      "Vitamin K2\n",
      "Vitamin K3\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally occurring form of Vitamin K is Vitamin K1 which is found in plants. These plants become the primary source of Vitamin K in humans, after being consumed in the form of food.\n",
      " The vitamin is required for synthesis of a protein which is vital for processes like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood coagulation (clotting)\n",
      "Bone metabolism (the protein helps to bind Calcium ions to bones and tissues)\n",
      "Prevention of Vascular Mineralization\n",
      "Other cellular functions\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin K1, also called as phylloquinone, is largely found in green leafy vegetables as they are useful in the process of photosynthesis\n",
      "Bacteria in the large intestine can convert K1 to Vitamin K2 (menaquinone)\n",
      "Menaquinones are generally found in animal livers and fermented food\n",
      "Another bacteria, Bacillus natto has been found to convert Vitamin K1 to K2 during the production of fermented soy products\n",

      "Synthetic Forms of K3 (menadione) have been found to be toxic\n",
      "VK storage capacity is very limited and so the body recycles it, by a process called as Vitamin K oxidation-reduction cycle\n",
      "Certain drugs like warfarin, are known to obstruct Vitamin K absorption and metabolism\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is Vitamin K2 produced in the body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin K2 also known as menaquinone, is synthesized by the bacteria in the gastro-intestinal tracts. K2 is absorbed and sent to the blood vessel walls, bones and tissues excepting the liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is Vitamin K absorbed in the body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin K, primarily in the form of phylloquinone, is absorbed in a form which is chemically unchanged after solubilisation. The absorption takes place in the proximal part of the intestine after bile salts and products of pancreatic lipolysis, form micelles with the soluble form of phylloquinone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is Vitamin K stored in the body?\n",
      "\n",

      "The vitamin deficiency does not weaken the clotting mechanism of the body, mainly among adults\n",
      "The deficiency may create problems in infants as Vitamin K cannot move through the placenta to the fetus effectively. It takes weeks to build up the stores of the vitamin.\n",
      "Clotting Problems related to deficiency can be seen among people with severe gastro-intestinal or liver problems\n",

      "Vitamin K keeps demineralization of bones in check\n",
      "\n",
      "A type of bone cell called as osteoclast is responsible for demineralization of bones\n",
      "The osteoclasts take minerals from the bones and make them available for other bodily functions\n",
      "A form of vitamin K2, the MK4, keeps the formation of osteoclasts under control\n",
      "MK4 also initiates the programmed cell death by a process called as apoptosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Carboxylation: Vitamin K increases the carboxylation of osteocalcin to keep the bones healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteocalcin is a protein that needs to be changed by a process called carboxylation\n",
      "When bones have fewer carboxylated osteocalcin, it is prone to fractures\n",
      "Vitamin K is essential for the proper functioning of the carboxylase enzymes, that helps in carboxylation of the protein\n",
      "The vitamin helps to restore the bone protein to its proper places and strengthens the composition of bones\n",
      "The K2 form, particularly MK4, is helpful in post menopausal bone protection\n",

      "Who discovered Vitamin K?\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1929, a Danish scientist called as Henrik Dam first discovered Vitamin K1. He uncovered this by investigating the role of cholesterol in chickens, by providing them with only cholesterol-free food. After a certain amount of time, the chickens began hemorrhaging and bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the right amount of Vitamin K which is required by the body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin K, like other supplements, should be taken under the strict supervision of a physician, especially before giving to a child. Some people have difficulty in absorbing nutrients like Vitamin K as they are suffering from conditions like:\n",
