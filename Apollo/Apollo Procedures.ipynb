      "Cochlear implant is a small electronic device which has both internal and external parts. The device stimulates the cochlear nerve (responsible for hearing) to deliver the sense of sound. Cochlear implant surgery can help you in hearing better. However, it does not restore or cure your hearing loss.\n",
      "Why is it done?\n",
      "You are suggested to undergo Cochlear implant surgery, if:\n",
      "\n",
      "You are currently experiencing hearing loss in both the ears\n",

      "You do not have any other medical issues that can increase risk of surgery\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens during the procedure?\n",
      "Cochlear implant surgery will be performed under general anaesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision behind the ear to open the mastoid bone. The Facial nerve is identified and an opening is made to access the cochlea. Once the cochlea is opened, implant electrodes are inserted into it. The receiver (an electronic device) is placed under the skin behind the ear and incision site is closed.\n",
      "How long will it take?\n",
      "Cochlear implant surgery lasts for about 2-4 hours depending upon your condition. Your surgeon will explain to you in detail about the surgery.\n",
      "What happens after the procedure?\n",
      "You will be prescribed pain management medication and discharge will be planned based on your recovery. Your follow-up visit will be scheduled. After 4-6 weeks, the external part of the device will be added. You will learn about taking care of the external device and how to use it. You might be recommended to visit speech-language therapists and audiologists.\n",
      "Apollo expertise in the procedure \n",
      "The experts at Apollo Hospitals has helped many children and elders with their hearing impairment. Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad has successfully performed more than 1500 cochlear implant surgeries, which is the largest program in South Asia. The youngest to receive bilateral cochlear implant using N7 device was performed by Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Delhi.\n",

      "What happens during the procedure?\n",
      "You will be given a sedative, which will help relax you. You will lie down on a table on your side with your knees bent and drawn up to your stomach. This position makes it easier for the doctor to pass the colonoscope into your anus and rectum and up into your colon. \n",
      "Your doctor can view the images of the colon on a screen. As the scope is passed through your colon, air is pumped into the colon so that your doctor can have a better view of the lining of the colon. This air may make you feel bloated and give you cramps. The colonoscope consists of a tiny camera to enable your doctor to study the images. During this procedure, your doctor can take tissue samples for biopsy or remove polyps or other abnormal tissue. \n",
      "How long will it take?\n",
      "Colonoscopy usually takes 30 to 60 minutes.\n",
      "What happens after the procedure?\n",
      "It is normal to have intestinal gas and mild cramps for a few hours after the exam. You should be accompanied by someone to take you home. If polyp is removed, your doctor will advise you a temporary special diet. Be sure to drink lots of fluids after the test. You may notice a small amount of blood in your stools for a short time; if it increases inform your doctor immediately. \n",

      "This procedure varies from patient to patient depending upon the condition to be treated. Generally, your head will be shaved and you will be given general anaesthesia. Then your head will be placed in a skull fixation device to hold it still during the surgery. Your surgeon will make an incision on the scalp and the flap of the skin and muscles are lifted and pulled back to expose the skull. Your surgeon will remove a small piece of skull bone (bone flap) and set it aside. Next, cut is made through dura. Having obtained the access, your surgeon performs the required surgery. Dura is closed and bone flap is reattached in its place. The skin incision site is closed.\n",

This procedure is performed to enable a titanium clip to be placed on the neck of the aneurysm to prevent it from bleeding. A cut is made over the area where the brain needs to be opened. A segment of skull bone is removed. A titanium clip is placed across the neck of the aneurysm. If a clip is unable to completely secure the aneurysm, a small amount of gauze may be required to be wrapped around the aneurysm. The skull bone is reattached and is closed with metal plates and screws. The cut is closed with stitches or staples.\n",
      "What is a craniotomy and resection of intrinsic lesion?\n",
      "A craniotomy and resection of intrinsic lesion is performed to remove a lesion from within the brain. An incision is made over the area of the lesion and a segment of bone is removed. If your surgeon is unable to see the lesion on the surface of the brain, a cut is made into the brain to expose the lesion. Through a computerised navigation system, the lesion can be located. Once lesion is removed, the skull bone is put back and is closed with metal plates and screws & the cut is closed with stitches or staples.\n",

      "Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure which is performed to diagnose problems in the gallbladder, bile ducts, and pancreas. Your liver secretes a fluid called bile that helps with digestion. The gallbladder helps in storage of bile until it is required for digestion. The bile duct carries bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. These ducts make up the biliary tree. The pancreas is a gland that produces enzymes which helps in digestion and also secretes hormones such as insulin.\n",

      "ERCP also helps to detect and treat problems following gallbladder surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens during the procedure?\n",
      "ERCP is a technique that combines the use of X-rays and an endoscope. A special long, flexible, lighted tube is used. The endoscope enables your doctor to view the inside of the stomach and duodenum, and inject dyes into the ducts in the biliary tree and pancreas so they can be seen on X-rays.\n",
      "During the procedure, you will be lying on a table. You will be given local anaesthesia and a sedative to relax. Your doctor will guide the endoscope through your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum till the spot where the bile duct opens into the duodenum. Dye is injected and X-ray equipment is used to take pictures. This will give a better view about narrowing, or blockage of the ducts. If required, your doctor can take a biopsy for further evaluation, or even remove gallbladder stone or blockage. Once procedure is done, endoscope will be removed.\n",
      "How long will it take?\n",

      "Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is used to determine if a cardiac patient really needs a stent or bypass surgery or can be kept only on medicines avoiding any procedure. This highly scientific and evidence based procedure is beneficial to the patient as FFR technology not only saves lives while avoiding unnecessary surgery but also helps patients to save cost. Fractional flow reserve – guided stent implantation has been established to be economically attractive in cost-effectiveness analysis.\n",
      "Patients with heart disease have blockages in the blood vessels (arteries) of their heart. When these blockages limit the amount of blood able to flow through the artery, they are “hemodynamically significant” or “serious blocks.” These “serious or tight” blockages often cause frightening symptoms such as chest discomfort or shortness of breath and can cause a heart attack. Blockages in blood vessels are identified during diagnostic Coronary Angiogram which forms the basis of most decisions whether the particular patient needs a stent or bypass or only medicines. This approach is perfectly reasonable when the Angiogram clearly demonstrates either a severely blocked blood vessel or a normal one. However, Angiography has well-known limitations and the significance of lesions of moderate severity is often difficult to determine based on just the Angiogram.\n",
      "The blockages are often assessed visually and the narrowing is described as 50% or 90% depending on the visual severity of the narrowing. Most of the blocks above 70% are treated by stents or bypass surgery. But very often we come across blockages around 60% or 70% where the decision to treat by surgery or medicine is not clear. This uncertainty may result in inappropriate care with stenting of non flow limiting lesions (non – serious) or failure to treat significant or serious blocks which can cause a heart attack.\n",
      "Now with advances and availability of scientific data, Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) procedure is done to measure how “tight or serious” a blockage is. The FFR is defined as the ratio between distal heart blood vessel pressure and aortic pressure, both measured simultaneously at maximal flow using a tiny coronary pressure guide wire. FFR is determined by a carefully calibrated sensor that measures the blood pressure upstream and downstream (before and after the block) after the administration of medicine like adenosine to induce maximum flow.\n",
      "Fractional Flow Reserve is physiologically based and describes the ratio of the maximum achievable flow in the presence of a stenosis to the theoretical maximum flow in the same vessel in the absence of a stenosis. It takes into consideration the multiple, complex variables influencing coronary flow including lesion severity, lesion length and collateral flow.\n",
      "Thus, if the FFR finds the difference between the two measurements is significant, then the blockage is considered to be significant. FFR has been shown to correlate very well with non-invasive stress testing and is considered to be complementary to a conventional Angiogram, particularly when the tightness of a blockage is difficult to establish by Angiography or when patients have not had non-invasive stress testing.\n",

      "The frequency of Hip Arthroscopies has been increasing explosively over the past years, leading to a hugely improved technique and greater understanding of the arthroscopic anatomy of the hip joint. Arthroscopic hip procedures can successfully treat conditions previously unrecognized or only treatable by open procedures. Improvements in technology have made the procedure accessible and reproducible. Arthroscopy for intra-articular conditions and endoscopy for periarticular pathologies continue to evolve. With the increased understanding of hip pathology and the onset of new concepts such as femoroacetabular impingement, the need for an arthroscopic access not only to the central compartment of the hip but also to the periphery became evident.\n",
      "Hip Arthroscopy is one of the most rapidly evolving arthroscopy techniques. It combines the benefits of a Minimally Invasive procedure and a short rehabilitation period. Improved instrumentation and technical skills have advanced our ability to accurately diagnose and treat various conditions. The role of this procedure continues to evolve with new indications that might change the outcome of degenerative joint disease of the hip joint.\n",
      "Hip arthroscopy is indicated for both traumatic and atraumatic intra and extra-articular conditions. Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is increasingly recognized as a disorder that can lead to progressive articular chondral and labral injury. A variety of arthroscopic techniques allows the treatment of labral and acetabular rim pathology as well as peripheral compartment femoral head-neck abnormalities. It is now recognized that labral tears that were traditionally treated with simple debridement are often associated with underlying FAI.\n",
      "Hip arthroscopy is also being used for surgery to the structures surrounding the hip as snapping hip syndromes, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, and arthroscopic repair of abductor tendon tears. Better understanding of the arthroscopic anatomy, improved operative techniques, lowered complication rate and objective outcome measuring tools will further define the optimal role of hip arthroscopy and improve its outcome.\n",

This can lead to bursting of appendix further causing life-threatening infection (peritonitis) in your abdomen.\n",
      "What happens during the procedure?\n",
      "The laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgical technique involves making several tiny cuts in the abdomen and inserting a miniature camera and surgical instruments. Generally, three or four incisions are made while viewing an enlarged image of your internal organs on the screen which guide the surgeons as they remove the appendix. The small incisions are then closed.\n",

MICAS or MICS CABG surgery is considered to be a safe and complete operation and has revolutionised the way coronary surgery is performed. Apollo Hospitals has successfully completed 400 and more CABG surgeries in India.\n",
      "MICS CABG or MICAS stands for Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and is a newer form of heart bypass surgery in India. It is a relatively new and advanced technique of performing coronary bypass for the treatment of coronary heart diseases. In this technique, the heart is approached through the side of the left chest via a small 4 cm incision. This cut is placed just under the nipple. The chest is entered between the ribs without cutting any bones and by splitting the muscle.\n",
      "Similar to a regular heart surgery, the operation is performed using all arteries or a combination of arteries and veins removed from the leg. The vessel from the leg in these operations is also removed endoscopically without cutting the skin over the leg. With highly advanced instrumentation, advanced techniques and skilled Clinicians, Apollo Hospitals performs the surgery very safely, making it one of the best hospitals for CABG surgeries in India.\n",
      "Among different types of CABG surgeries in India, Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery has several advantages over the traditional technique:\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost is the fact that no bones are cut. This has several advantages in reducing pain, retaining function and having a positive effect on breathing. Unlike traditional heart surgery, return to normal life including driving or other activities is not disrupted and can be started almost immediately.\n",
      "Blood loss is almost negligible eliminating blood transfusion in most and eliminating blood borne infection.\n",
      "All infections are reduced whether it be wound infections or post-surgical lung infection. This makes the procedure ideal in diabetics and older patients who have poor resistance to infection.\n",
      "The incision is so cosmetic and measures just 2 – 3 inches that it’s practically impossible to tell that a heart operation has been done.\n",
      "The procedure lasts only 4 days unlike the conventional heart surgery that takes 9 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these benefits put together make for very short hospitalization and recovery. The best part is that all the blocks irrespective of their location in the heart can be bypassed in a safe and predictable manner.\n",
      " \n",
      "FAQs\n",
      "1. What is MICS CABG?\n",
      "This is a technique of coronary artery bypass or CABG wherein the entire operation is performed from the side of the chest (on the left) through an incision that is about 2 inches.\n",
      "2. How does it differ from conventional CABG?\n",
      "Conventional CABG or Coronary artery bypass requires the breast bone or sternum to be cut into half. Recovery from conventional bypass surgery requires a longer duration upto 8 weeks as the bone needs to heal. In MICS CABG, the operation is performed through the side of the chest wall. No bones are cut and healing is rapid. Healing is usually complete in ten days.\n",
      "3. Will MICS CABG help me leave the hospital early and get back to work?\n",
      "Definitely yes! This is exactly the reason to do this operation. Hospital stay is as short as 2 days and most patients get back to work or normal in 10 days.\n",
      "4. Is it a beating heart operation?\n",
      "Yes, it is an off pump or beating heart operation. The support of a pump may rarely be required but the operation is still performed on the beating heart. Pump support may particularly be used when the heart is weak.\n",
      "5. Are MICS CABG and MIDCAB one and the same?\n",
      "No, they are not the same. MIDCAB is an old technique where only one or two vessels can be grafted. It is often confused with the modern MICS CABG if one is unaware about recent developments.\n",
      "6. I am a diabetic. Is MICS CABG appropriate for me?\n",
      "Absolutely. You may be the ideal candidate for MICS as infection rates are almost epminated. The quality of your vessels will dictate whether you are suitable for this technique and your surgeon is the best judge.\n",
      "7. What is the risk of infections after MICS CABG?\n",
      "The risk of infection is close to zero. All infections are reduced dramatically in MICS CABG even in diabetics.\n",
      "8. I am a smoker/asthmatic. Is MICS CABG still an option for me?\n",
      "Yes. It could be the ideal option for you. It’s best for your surgeon to take that decision along with your respiratory therapist.\n",
      "9. Are all patients with multivessel blocks candidates for MICS CABG?\n",
      "No, not all patients with multivessel coronary blocks are candidates. Those with extensive disease or very poor heart function are not suitable for this technique. Your heart surgeon is the best person to decide whether you are a candidate or not for this kind of operation.\n",
      "10. Is MICS CABG performed in all centers?\n",
      "No, not all heart surgeons are trained in MICS. Including ours, there are only a handful of centers all over the world that are capable of performing MICS safely.\n",
      "Endoscopic Vein Harvesting\n",
      "Endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) adds benefit to MICS CABG. State of the art equipment ensures quality with exceptional patient comfort. EVH is a technique of harvesting the leg vein used as bypass conduits with an endoscope.\n",

      "\n",
      "The purpose of orthognathic surgery/ corrective jaw surgery is to correct functional and cosmetic problems that are due to underlying jaw deformities. Orthognathic surgery is often the treatment solution in cases where the bite problem is so severe that orthodontic braces alone aren’t enough to correct the problem or where orthodontics alone would compromise your facial appearance.\n",
      "One of the most rewarding aspects of orthognathic surgery is improved beauty and self-esteem.\n",
      "Severe bony deformities caused by jaw mismatch in size and position may cause serious problems. For example, extremely small lower jaw may result in snoring and sleep apnea, which can consequently cause many health problems. In cases of short upper lip and vertical excess of the upper jaw, the lips are usually open as they fail to close without efforts due to increased lower third of the face. Consequently, it may stimulate undesirable mouth breathing which further worsens occlusion. Frequently malocclusion can have strong negative effect on speech function and often it can be accompanied by jaw joint pain.\n",
      "Last but not least, occlusion and the position of jaws define the height of the lower third of the face to the greatest extent, hence the aesthetics of the facial profile as well. Convex ‘bird face’ or concave ‘mature face’ profiles are considered anaesthetic, therefore severe anomalies can cause social problems if left untreated.\n",
      "Scientists have been on the way in seeking an answer to this question for years trying to find which part of the face is playing the greatest role in the attractiveness of the face, and surgeon’s trying to “attack” those parts, thus hoping to make the face more attractive by changing particular features. Do we look at the eyes, at the smile, the symmetry of the face or at the combination of several features like nose, cheeks, eyebrows or eyes when assessing facial attractiveness?\n",
      "Orthognathic surgery is surgery performed on the bones of the jaws to change their positions. Orthognathic surgery is corrective facial surgery where deformities of the jaw exist. It may be indicated for functional, cosmetic, or health reasons. It is surgery commonly done on the jaws in conjunction with orthodontic treatment, which straightens the teeth.\n",

      "A lesion or growth that is present for more than ten to fourteen days is generally biopsied. A biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a section or the entire growth is removed depending on the size, location and nature of the growth. Growths in the oral cavity are typically benign in nature. A malignant lesion, or oral cancer is less common in the general population. However, due to the innocuous appearance of some oral cancer all suspicious lesions should be biopsied.\n",
      "Most biopsies are performed in the clinic under local anesthetic. For those patients who prefer, a light sedation or general anesthesia can be administered. Following removal of the lesion, the biopsied specimen is sent to an oral pathologist for a final diagnosis. The diagnosis would dictate the need for possible further treatment. Further treatment would include simple excision of the disease alone to removal of the affected parts of jaw and face followed by reconstruction with a microvascular free flap.\n",

      "It is a “root” device, usually made of titanium, used in dentistry to support restorations that resemble a tooth or group of teeth to replace missing teeth. Virtually all dental implants placed today are root-form endosseous implants, i.e., they appear similar to an actual tooth root (and thus possess a “root-form”) and are placed within the bone (endo- being the Greek prefix for “in” and osseous referring to “bone”). The bone of the jaw accepts and osseointegrates with the titanium post. Osseointegration refers to the fusion of the implant surface with the surrounding bone. Dental implants will fuse with bone, however they lack the periodontal ligament, so they will feel slightly different than natural teeth during chewing.\n",
      "Dental implants can be used to support a number of dental prostheses, including crowns, implant-supported bridges or dentures. They can also be used as anchorage for orthodontic tooth movement. The use of dental implants permits undirectional tooth movement without reciprocal action. They are the only way to provide fixed teeth for jaws which have been reconstructed with bone grafts or free flaps.\n",

      "Mitral clip is a niche device to treat patients with severe mitral valve leak without open heart surgery. Our heart has four valves. These valves regulate blood flow through the heart. The mitral valve which is on the left side of the heart controls blood flow from the atrium to the ventricle. This valve has two leaflets that open and close within the heart ensuring that blood travels in only one direction.\n",
      "Mitral regurgitation is leakage of blood backward to the left atrium through the mitral valve each time the left ventricle contracts. The heart’s mitral valve does not close tightly enough. This lets some of the blood in your heart flow backward or “regurgitate,” into your heart chamber. As a result, the heart must work harder to push blood through the body. Common symptoms caused by this increased workload include fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing, an irregular heartbeat and worsening heart failure. Mitral regurgitation is a progressive disease that can eventually impact your quality of life and make daily activities more difficult.\n",
      "MitraClip is breakthrough innovative catheter-based technology that uses a small clip attached to the mitral valve to treat degenerative mitral regurgitation. MitraClip allows the mitral valve to close more completely, helping to restore normal blood flow through the heart. It’s a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with mitral regurgitation (valve leak) who are not good candidates for surgery.\n",
      "Selection Process for MitraClip Therapy\n",
      "The goal of treatment is to reduce the mitral regurgitation and improve overall quality of life. Medications may reduce the symptoms, but cannot fix the valve itself. The current treatment for severely leaking mitral valve is to perform repair or replacement of the mitral valve with open heart surgery. Open heart mitral valve surgery is an effective and well-proven way to treat the mitral regurgitation, but not all patients are suitable for open heart surgery. If a patient has other medical problems, open heart surgery can be too high risk.\n",
      "In such cases, Mitral clip may be good option to treat the leaking valve without open heart surgery. First step is to check whether the patient is suitable for the mitral clip procedure; which will be decided by our team consisting of Cardiologists who are leaders in structural interventions along with the Cardiac Surgeon and Cardiac Anesthesiologist. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE), is an important test to decide the suitability and specific measurements of the mitral valve. With these information, our MitraClip Heart team will discuss the case details, to make sure that the patient is getting the right procedure and would be benefited by this procedure. If a patient is not found suitable for the MitraClip procedure, it means that the patient will not be benefited from this procedure and may do better with open heart surgery or with current prescribed medications alone.\n",
      "The MitraClip procedure is performed in the cathlab, by inserting a catheter through the groin. The catheter a long, flexible tube is inserted into a large vein in your groin (femoral vein) and guided to the heart. It is positioned using trans oesophageal echocardiogram and X-ray fluoroscopic images. Once the tip of the catheter has reached the heart, mitral valve is assessed with the transesophageal echocardiogram. The TEE aids in the correct placement of the MitraClip. Through the septal puncture – a tiny hole is made through the upper chambers (atria) of the heart, the catheter is inserted and guided to the left side, where the mitral valve is located. Through the steerable catheter, the MitraClip along with its delivery system is inserted and positioned by echocardiogram to the leaking portions of the valve. The clip is attached to the mitral valve leaflets, fastening them firmly together and allowing the valve to close better. Once the position of the clip is good with good reduction of the valve leak, the clip is released. One or more MitraClips may be used to fix a severely leaky valve. Patient will be given general anaesthesia during the entire procedure with TEE.\n",

      "Robotic Minimally Assisted CABG is the least invasive method of minimally Invasive cardiac surgery. Minimally invasive techniques have been developed to avoid sternal split and aid much quicker recovery. Robotic Assisted Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery involves making tiny holes in the left chest cavity through which surgery is performed with the help of Da Vinci Robotic system.\n",
      "Why is it done?\n",
      "Coronary Artery Disease is one of the most common non-communicable diseases affecting individuals in the Indian subcontinent. This condition can be treated by medicines, stent insertion or CABG surgery. Conventionally, CABG surgery was performed by splitting the central chest bone – Sternotomy. Sternotomy is the biggest fear for most patients and causes morbidity to most patients following cardiac surgery. In some cases, the patients have to cope with slow recovery of up to 3 months.\n",
      "What happens during the procedure?\n",
      "The surgery is performed under general anaesthesia. Your cardiac surgeon will make tiny holes in the left chest cavity. The surgical instruments which is attached to robotic arms and a camera is inserted through these holes. Your cardiac surgeon will control the robotic arms and camera from a console located in the same operation theatre. Once the surgery is complete, your surgeon will remove all the instruments and close the incisions.\n",
      "How long will it take?\n",
      "Robotic Minimally Assisted CABG takes less time to complete and patients have lesser complications and quicker recovery when compared to conventional surgery\n",
      "What happens after the procedure?\n",
      "After surgery you will be monitored for recovery. Patients generally have less blood loss, minimal pain and faster recover. Based on your recovery you will be discharged 2 to 3 days after surgery. However, full recovery will take approximately 2 weeks. At the time of discharge, your doctor will give you few guidelines which includes your medications, dietary instructions etc.\n",

      "Surgery for Parkinsons disease\n",
      "Apollo Hospitals has been in the forefront for surgery of Parkinson’s disease from as early as the ’60s and ’70s. It has brought the latest in surgery for Parkinson’s disease – Sub Thalamic Nucleus (STN) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) to India. Similar to a Cardiac Pacemaker, here also a pacemaker is implanted into the brain. The procedure is done under local anesthesia. The results are visible immediately and are sustained.\n",
      "What is DBS?\n",
      "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure used to treat a variety of neurological symptoms-most commonly the symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD), such as tremor, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems. The procedure is also used to treat essential tremor, a common neurological movement disorder. DBS does not damage healthy brain tissue by destroying nerve cells. Instead the procedure blocks electrical signals from targeted areas in the brain.\n",
      "DBS is often described as a pacemaker for the brain. It works much like a pacemaker, sending electrical signals to the brain instead of the heart. It is primarily utilized for patients who have Parkinsons disease, dystonia, or essential tremor (ET), and who cant adequately control their disease with medication.\n",
      "For those with Parkinsons, DBS can reduce tremors and significantly improve slowness and stiffness; and make tremors disappear for those with ET. DBS can help relax muscles and improve abnormal postures caused by muscle contractions for those with dystonia. In all cases, DBS can help enhance quality of life.\n",
      "Its important to understand that DBS does not offer a cure for your disease, but a way to manage it more effectively. It can offer many benefits, including the need to take less medication and therefore experience fewer medication side effects.\n",
      " \n",
      "FAQS about DBS\n",
      "When is a good time to consider DBS? Am I a good candidate?\n",
      "There are somewhat different criteria for determining if DBS is a good option for you based on your diagnosis and condition. For Parkinsons disease, DBS is typically helpful if you experience motor fluctuations or tremors that interfere with activities that are not already adequately managed by medication, are not improved by changes in medication, or you experience side effects that prevent you from taking higher doses. For ET, DBS may be considered if you have tremors that interfere with your quality of life and cannot be controlled adequately with medications. Other key factors considered are age in combination with general health, a solid support system of family and friends, absence of dementia or an active psychiatric illness such as severe depression, and realistic expectations for treatment outcomes.\n",
      "Before any patient is considered for DBS surgery, they are evaluated by the U-M Surgical Therapies Improving Movement (STIM) multidisciplinary team, which has extensive training in DBS. The STIM team includes a neurosurgeon, neurologist, clinical neuropsychologist, speech pathologist, social worker, and other team members who ensure that you and your family understand the procedure and discuss your expectations and concerns.\n",
      "What does DBS feel like when the device is on?\n",
      "During the initial programming of the DBS, individuals may experience a slight, temporary shock or tingling as placement and levels are adjusted. Identifying the best placement and level enables you to receive the greatest benefit possible based on your unique condition and needs.\n",
      "Does the DBS procedure need to be done with MRI? I have a pacemaker and cannot get an MRI.\n",
      "The MRI provides the clearest and most detailed picture of the brain. This is the preferred method to make sure the best outcomes are achieved. However, DBS surgery can be performed using CT guidance. CT, or computed tomography, is a way of imaging the brain, but the detail in the pictures is not as good as with MRI. This may lead to suboptimal outcomes. CT-guided DBS is easier with ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus placement (done with essential tremor), as the VIM nucleus (a part of the thalamus section of the brain) is a bigger structure and not as deep. CT-guided DBS is much more technically difficult if the neurosurgeon is trying to place a lead in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a part of the basal ganglia section of the brain, but it can be done. If you have a pacemaker, this will be discussed as part of your surgical planning.\n",
      "Where would you put the DBS stimulator if I already have a pacemaker?\n",
      "Pacemakers are typically placed in the same pocket in the chest where DBS stimulators are placed. Because pacemakers are placed on the left side of the chest, the DBS stimulator could be placed on the right side of the chest. Another alternative would be to place the DBS stimulator just under the skin of the abdomen. The extension wires from the leads to the stimulator would be longer, which would put it at higher risk for lead fracture, but there is generally more padding in the abdomen, so the stimulator does not stick out as much.\n",
      "What if the stimulator battery runs out? What will happen?\n",
      "If the stimulator battery runs out, if you have Parkinsons you should contact your neurosurgeon or the STIM team as soon as possible. They may tell you to go into the emergency room, and an urgent battery replacement will be scheduled. If you have dystonia, the symptoms of your dystonia may come back over days to weeks. Again, this will be more of an urgent issue, and you should contact the DBS neurosurgeon or STIM team as soon as possible. Following up with your DBS team for regular monitoring of your battery will greatly reduce the chances of your battery running out unexpectedly.\n",
      "Will others be able to see my DBS device?\n",
      "Once you are healed, there is very little evidence that can be seen. At some centers, a small amount of hair is shaved above your forehead on the top of your head at the time of Stage I. Most women and some men are able to style their hair in such a way that this is not very noticeable. However, if you have short hair, or no hair, the incisions are likely to be visible to others until you are healed. If your DBS center shaves the entire head, then the incisions will certainly be visible until they heal and your hair grows back. There will be a 2- to 4-inch incision in the scalp on the top of the head and a smaller incision behind the ear. Once healed, the incisions will leave scars that will be visible on balding heads but are well-covered when hair grows back.\n",
      "The scalp will have bumps where the holes were drilled. The holes are filled with plastic caps that sit just under the scalp, leaving a small raised area. Again, in those with hair, this is not visible. In balding men, the raised areas on the scalp are more visible. The extension wire that runs from the lead(s) in the brain to the stimulator is tunneled in the fatty tissue just under the skin. For most, the track of the extension wire is not visible. However, for those that are thin, it may appear as a large vein would, just under the skin.\n",
      "The stimulator lies under the skin, just below the collar bone. Once healed, there will be a 3- to 5-inch scar from the incision. The stimulator site will be slightly raised. This is more noticeable in those that are thin. It may be noticeable if one is wearing a bathing suit or low cut blouse. However, this generally is not seen through clothing.\n",
      "I need tremor control in both of my hands to perform my job. Can I have DBS for both hands?\n",
      "If you have Parkinsons disease, you are likely to have bilateral surgery with placement of leads in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) and experience tremor control in both hands. If you have essential tremor (ET), lead placement occurs in the ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus, but often only on one side. This is done to see if there is enough benefit with tremor control in one hand.\n",
      "How do I know when to use my DBS?\n",
      "Individuals with Parkinsons disease or dystonia will be instructed to leave the stimulator on continuously. There is no need to turn off the stimulators, unless undergoing a medical procedure. Those with essential tremor who have leads placed in the ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus can turn the stimulator on or off, depending on when tremor control is needed. Many people turn the stimulator on in the morning upon waking and off at bedtime.\n",
      "Can I do my own programming?\n",
      "Finding the correct contact on your DBS lead can only be done by the DBS neurologist or nurse who does the initial programming. However, some of the newer stimulators on the market allow the DBS neurologist to set different programs. For example, they could set it so you would be able turn your stimulator voltage up to a pre-set level, or switch your settings back to the same settings you had at the previous visit.\n",
      "I have essential tremor that affects my voice. Will DBS help the tremor in my voice?\n",
      "Although DBS is excellent for helping the tremor that is experienced in the hands and arms due to essential tremor, it is unlikely that DBS will help your voice with just a unilateral lead.\n",
      "Why would you choose the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as a site for Parkinsons disease? It seems that it is associated with more problems than the globus pallidus interna (GPi)?\n",
      "In a recent large DBS trial comparing STN to GPi DBS for Parkinsons disease, there was not much difference in the effect on motor symptoms. STN had a slight advantage in that people were able to reduce their medications more. In other studies, GPi is reported to have less depression and fewer problems with cognition after surgery, but in the large DBS trial, there really were not any clinically significant differences in outcome with respect to depression or cognition.\n",

      "Apollo Hospitals introduces “The Ideal Knee” – the future for Total Knee Replacement through a new technique – Attune Rotating Platform Knee Replacement, a first of its kind in South India.\n",
      "This revolutionary procedure performed by Dr Lenin Chinnusamy, Senior Orthopedic Surgeon has proved improved performance and great results.\n",
      "This innovative surgery was performed on both knees on a 63 year old patient who was suffering from Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypothyroidism and Coronary Artery disease for which he underwent CABG – Bypass heart surgery 5 years back.\n",
      "Though Knee Replacement surgery is a successful procedure, patients are not completely satisfied often because of the limitation of day to day activities like getting up from the chair,going up and down the stairs,siting on the floor etc..\n",
      "Some patients have discomfort and are not able to bend the knee completely after Total Knee Replacement despite having good pain relief. The present day knee implants last on an average 10-15 years. Many patients with Arthritis of the knee hesitate to undergo this surgery because of the prolonged post operative pain and recovery after the conventional Total Knee replacement.\n",
      "Attune Rotating Platform knee replacement along with Minimally Invasive Subvastus technique is a boon alleviating all the fear in the patient. This surgical procedure makes the patients feel their knee is a normal knee in regards to stability, mobility and function. Versatility in size and matching the patients anatomy makes this a – Personalised Knee. In other words, the custom made knee is now ready made. There is no time loss and no need for CT scan thus averting the radiation exposure – which is mandatory in the case of a custom made knee\n",
      "The functional durability and longevity of this knee is likely to be more than 30 years and it is very much suitable for patients between 45-55 as well as for obese patients.\n",
      "The Minimally Invasive Subvastus technique differs completely from the conventional technique. In the conventional surgery the skin is cut 15-20cm along with the muscles infront of the knee and thigh, the knee cap is flipped and the thigh and leg bones are separated from each other to perform the conventional surgery resulting in prolonged post operative pain and recovery. Whereas in the Minimally Invasive Subvastus technique the skin is cut only 8-10cm.The muscles are preserved by pushing them to the side without cutting them. The knee cap is not flipped and the thigh and leg bones are not separated but are cut in place. All these resulting in less pain and quick recovery.\n",
      "The combined benefits of the new implant and the surgical technique make this procedure as the ‘Ideal Total Knee Replacement’ for patients who are waiting for it.\n",
      "In short, patients can get back to their everyday activities they love to do, more comfortably and confidently within a month or two.\n",

      "TORS was developed by Dr Gregory Weinstein and Dr. Bert O’Malley in 2004 at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (PENN) and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009.\n",
      "During TORS, the surgeon uses a sophisticated, computer – enhanced system which displays a magnified,\n",
      "3 – D view of the surgical area that enables him to visualize the procedure in much greater detail than in a traditional surgery. TORS gives the surgeon an enhanced view of the cancer and surrounding tissue. Using a robotic system to guide the surgical tools, allows for more-precise movements in narrow spaces and the capability to work around corners. This result in preservation of maximum amount of healthy muscular and neurovascular tissue which helps the patient swallow on their own sooner and discharged home earlier.\n",
      "TORS has dramatically improved the way doctors treat  head and neck cancer patients, completely removing tumors while preserving speech, swallowing, and resulting in a quicker recovery.\n",
